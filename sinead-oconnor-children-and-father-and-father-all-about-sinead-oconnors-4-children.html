More than being a renowned musician, Sinead O’Connor was also a proud mother. On July 26, her family shared with RTE the sad news of her passing at the age of 56. Their statement read, “It is with deep sorrow that we report the death of our dear Sinead. His family and friends are grief-stricken and request privacy during this exceptionally challenging period.” The artist, whose 1990 debut song “Nothing Compares 2 U,” written by Prince, topped the charts, was a mother to four children, including her late son Shane O’Connor, who tragically died at 17. Despite enduring personal issues such as abuse from his mother in his childhood and mental health issues, he always took great pride in his offspring. O’Connor mostly shielded her children from the public gaze, but in 2021, she spoke warmly about them during an interview with People. Here’s everything you need to know about her four children.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-black-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size">Sinéad O’Connor Children and Father</h2><p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>Jake Reynolds</strong></p><p class="has-black-color has-text-color">In 1987, O’Connor’s first child, son Jake Reynolds, was born to her and music producer John Reynolds. A decade later, in 2015, Jake and his girlfriend Lia welcomed their first child, a boy, making O’Connor a grandmother. The news was joyfully announced by O’Connor on Facebook, posting a comic that read, “It’s a boy,” with the caption: “Don’t mess with grandma.” In her 2021 conversation with People, O’Connor mentioned, “I see [my children] as often as they wish to see me,” a frequency that had dwindled with her adult children, who were occupied with their own kids. She also divulged that her two oldest children were in the food industry: Jake is a chef, and Roisin is a pastry chef. More details about Sinead O’Connor’s spouse.</p><p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>Roisin Waters</strong></p><p class="has-black-color has-text-color">In 1995, O’Connor had her only daughter, Roisin Waters, with journalist John Waters. After Roisin’s birth, a protracted custody battle ensued between O’Connor and Waters. Following a suicide attempt, O’Connor handed over Roisin’s custody to Waters, as MTV News reported in 1999. In 2014, Roisin made a rare public appearance with her mother when they performed a duet on Icelandic television. Despite possessing an “impressive singing voice,” O’Connor expressed her relief to People in 2021 that her daughter had chosen to become a pastry chef rather than pursuing a career in the music industry. “I was fearful of her entering the music business because I worried she would be treated as they have treated me,” she explained. “I didn’t want that for her.”</p><p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>Shane Lunny</strong></p><p class="has-black-color has-text-color">In 2004, O’Connor’s third child, a son named Shane Lunny, was born to her and Irish singer Donal Lunny. In her 2021 interview with People, she referred to Shane as “a real mommy’s boy … He’s always loved his mommy from the day he was born.” O’Connor also mentioned that her then-teenage son was more interested in following his mother’s musical footsteps than attending college. “He’s the one who always says he wants to be a musician,” she stated. “He has a fantastic way with words. When he was eight, he was referred to a special agency that assessed his intellect, and they claimed that in his usage of vocabulary, he was equivalent to a 16-year-old. He is a master of English. So, he aspires to be a rapper primarily, which I believe he would be excellent at since he’s a master wordsmith.”</p><p class="has-black-color has-text-color">However, in 2022, tragedy struck when Shane took his own life at the age of 17, a week after he went missing. “My beautiful son, Nevi’im Nesta Ali Shane O’Connor, the very light of my life, chose to end his earthly struggle today and is now with God,” she tweeted mournfully at the time. “May he rest in peace and may nobody follow his example. My baby, I love you so much. Please be at peace.” In a subsequent tweet, the “Nothing Compares to You” singer tweeted a Bob Marley song dedicated to Shane. “This is for my Shaney. The light of my life. The lamp of my soul. My blue-eyed baby,” she wrote. “You will always be my light. We will always be together. No boundary can separate us.” Just prior to O’Connor’s own passing in 2023, she posted another tribute to her son. “Been living as an undead night creature since,” his death, she wrote on Twitter. “He was the love of my life, the lamp of my soul. We were one soul split in two. He was the only person who ever loved me unconditionally. I’m lost in the bardo without him.”</p><p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>Yeshua Bonadio</strong></p><p class="has-black-color has-text-color">Her fourth child, a son named Yeshua Bonadio, was born in 2006, fathered by Frank Bonadio. In 2021, O’Connor spoke about Yeshua’s talents, noting that he was also a “remarkable musician…he plays the piano and everything amazingly and has a wonderful singing voice.” However, she also mentioned that Yeshua had many career options. “He’s half American, so he’s interested in going to college in the United States,” she commented at the time. “His father is a scientist. So, we’ll see. But I wouldn’t be surprised if he gets into music, as he has a liking for money.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK3RpJiroZWtrq56wqikaKuZo7KisIyomqimnqS%2Fbq%2FHoqOdqpWjeqK6w2admqyYmr9urc2dZJ%2BZpJ2ys3nApaNmmZKkwrV50qKlnpmUYryku82npqurXWl6pLTIpZurnZ5kgHqDk2lv</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./john-jamelske.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Grim Story Of John Jamelske, The 'Syracuse Dungeon Master'">&larr;
