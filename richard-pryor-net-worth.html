He was an actor, comedian, satirist, writer as well as a film director. Richard Pryor was the winner of five Grammy Awards, two American Academy of Humour Awards, Emmy Award, Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for American Humour and the Writers Guild of America Award. More, he topped the list of Comedy Central as the all-time greatest stand-up comedian. Undoubtedly, all those awards increased Richard Pryor’s net worth. He was active in the entertainment industry from 1963 to 1997.</p><p>So how rich was Pryor? The main sources of Richard Pryor’s net worth were acting and writing. According to estimations, his net worth was equal to $40 million.</p><h3>Richard Pryor Net Worth $40 Million</h3><p>The childhood of this charismatic actor was far from usual or happy: Richard was raised in a brothel owned by his grandma. Worse, his mother worked as a prostitute there. Later, she left the boy with grandma, who used to abuse the child physically and mentally. From 1958 to 1960, he served in the Army of USA, although almost all the time was spent in prison because of a racial discrimination incident in Germany.</p><p>Concerning his career, Pryor was influenced by such personalities as <a href=#>Lewis Black</a>, Bill Hicks, <a href=#>Dave Chappelle</a>, <a href=#>Eddie Izzard</a>, <a href=#>George Lopez</a>, <a href=#>George Carlin</a> and other famous artists. As an actor he created outstanding roles in a number of films including the blaxploitation film “The Mack” (1973) directed by Michael Campus, the sports comedy “The Bingo Long Travelling All-Stars & Motor Kings” (1976) directed by John Badham, comedy films “Which Way is Up?” (1977) directed by Michael Schultz, “The Toy” (1982) directed by <a href=#>Richard Donner</a>, “Brewster’s Millions” (1985) directed by <a href=#>Walter Hill</a>, “See No Evil, Hear No Evil” (1989) directed by Arthur Hiller and other films which all added considerable sums to the net worth of <a href=#>Richard Pryor</a>.</p><p>As a comedian he released about 20 albums and eight compilations. He debuted with the album “Richard Pryor” (1968) which was recorded live. Other popular albums were “That Nigger’s Crazy” (1974), “Bicentennial Nigger” (1976), “Wanted: Live in Concert” (1978), “Here and Now” (1983) and others. The albums received certifications for sales which meant that the net worth of the Richard Pryor rose significantly.</p><p>Pryor was particularly recognised for his constant racial epithets, insulting vocabulary, profanity and vulgarities, usually when discussing contemporary issues and racism cases. This was Richard Pryor’s own way of attract audiences, which consequently increased his net worth considerably as he was consistently adored by millions. He is considered to be one of the most influential and important comedians of all time.</p><p>As a result of the multiple sclerosis that Richard Pryor suffered from, he had to use power operated vehicles to move, but still he appeared in the film “Lost Highway” (1997) directed by <a href=#>David Lynch</a>. In 2005, he died following a heart attack, and was cremated.</p><p>The private life of Pryor was not usual, either. He managed to marry five women seven times, and fathered six children. Richard Pryor’s wives were Patricia Price (1960–1961), Shelley Bonis (1967–1969), Deborah McGuire (1977–1978), Jennifer Lee (1981–1982, 2001– until his death) and Flynn Belaine (1986–1987, 1990–1991).</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=44.025477707006><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Richard Pryor</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$40 Million</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 1,1940, in Peoria, Illinois USA</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Died</td><td>December 10, 2005 in Los Angeles, California, USA,</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Peoria</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.78&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Profession</td><td>Comedian, Actor, Screenwriter, Film Producer, Master of Ceremonies, Writer, Television producer</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Spouse</td><td>Jennifer Lee, Flynn Belaine, Deborah McGuire, Shelley R.
