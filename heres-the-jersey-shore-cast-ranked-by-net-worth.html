Unfortunately, many domestic disputes took place at the house and the police were called to the scene multiple times. In 2020, he announced that he was selling his home for $870,000. Still, the star has racked up a net worth of approximately <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$3 million</a> – but may be lower in more recent years due to some likely pricey legal fees and time away from Family Vacation after his 2021 arrest.

That gravy train soon came to a halt, as Angelina declined to return for a third season, as her feuds with every one of her co-stars reached an unbearable point – made clear by her constant fights in virtually every episode. She did, however, return for Family Vacation, on better terms with her castmates.</p><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true>Angelina Pivarnick has a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">net worth of $4 million</a> today, so her departure from Jersey Shore in its prime certainly hasn’t held her back.
