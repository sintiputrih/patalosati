And now, adding one more country to its list, </span><i><span>The Real Housewives of Dubai</span></i><span> is on the horizon with an amazing cast that includes the supermodel Chanel Ayan.</span></p><p><span>So, who is she? This “Chanel Ayan Bio” contains everything you need to know about her.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Chanel Ayan On RHODubai (Real Housewives Of Dubai)</b></h3><p><i><span>The Real Housewives of Dubai</span></i><span> premiered on June 1, 2022, and like any other franchise, it saw strong 6 independent women, with fascinating lifestyles, all aiming to make it big in the world.</span></p><p><span>Among them, Chanel Ayan is Dubai’s first Black supermodel who was known for her elegance and enviable style. Dubai’s been her home for over 18 years, and she has “watched in awe as the city has been built.”</span></p><p><span>However, not every day is a happy day on RHODubai. Her Bravo description read that Chanel would be confronted by demons from both her past and present until realizes she can only hide behind couture for so long.</span></p><p><span>Joining her for the inaugural season of RHODubai were her co-stars — Nina Ali (a co-founder of a successful cake company), Caroline Brooks (a realtor), Dr. Sara Al Madani (a prolific public speaker), <a href=#>Lesa Milan</a> (a fashion designer), and Caroline Stanbury (a fashion stylist).</span></p><p><span>All excited to appear on the show, Chanel took it to her IG on May 27, 2022, to share a promo clip, captioned, “AYAN BEAUTY Tune on June 1 @bravotv Dress @amatoofficial @furneamato”</span></p><p><span>For those of you who don’t know, RHODubai isn’t Chanel’s first time on TV. She reportedly made appearances in the movie franchises such as</span><i><span> Mission Impossible</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Fast and Furious</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Chanel Ayan Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>Chanel Ayan garnered a net worth of under $1.5 million by 2022. Well, given her over 2 decades of career in the modeling industry, it’s no surprise she was able to rack up a hefty sum.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This incarnation of beauty first started her career after moving to Brazil at 18. However, it was until years later after finally signing a deal with </span><i><span>Elite Model Agency </span></i><span>and settling in the UAE that Chanel found fame and garnered a large following in Africa and the Middle East. She even went on to be the first Black supermodel to grace the cover of a Dubai magazine.</span></p><p><span>Recalling her modeling debut in Dubai, Chanel shared that it took place at a royal Abu Dhabi fashion show. Since then, she’s worked for top fashion houses like Chanel, Tiffany, Cartier, Valentino, and Dolce & Gabbana. But her proudest achievement is being the muse for one of the biggest designers in the world, the Amato Couture.</span></p><p><span>However, unlike now, Chanel’s joinery was filled with adversity. As an African woman, she had to fight her way through everything, including event invitations and modeling jobs. But she always respected herself and believed in her own power. Her “unshakeable perseverance, determination, and flat-out refusal to accept anything less than what she deserves” is what got her to this position.</span></p><p><span>In the future, Chanel has thought of some “life-changing” projects. She’s on a journey inward — a mission to learn more about herself and to give the love she shares with everyone else back to herself.</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact: </b><span>Chanel has worked with stars like Rihanna and Iman.</span></p><h3><b>Is Chanel Ayan Married?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, Chanel Ayan is married to her husband of over 22 years, Chris. The two reportedly first met back in the 90s when Chanel had just moved to Brazil. Dating for a while, the lovebirds then moved to the USA, tied the knot, and finally settled down in the UAE.</span></p><p>Contrary to what you may read online, Chanel isn’t married to artist/model Luca Salves.</p><p><span>Together, Chanel and her husband Chris share a son named Taj who’s also dabbled in the world of modeling.</span></p><p><a href=#><span>Here</span></a><span>’s Taj’s IG. He turned 14 in 2022.</span></p><p><b>Trivia: </b><span>Taj has appeared on Chanel’s TikTok video dated March 13, 2021.</span></p><h3><b>Chanel Ayan Height</b></h3><p><span>Chanel Ayan stands tall at a height of 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm).</span></p><p><span>Her distinct features include — hollow cheeks, a long face, and a mole over her nose and chin.</span></p><h3><b>Chanel Ayan Parents</b></h3><p><span>Chanel Ayan comes from a family of seven. Sadly, her father had drinking problems. So, her mother had to raise all five kids on her own. And she’s done a darn good job raising them! Chanel’s a supermodel, her brother’s a lawyer, the other is an engineer at Apple and her two sisters are a nurse and an employee of a Tourism Company.</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, Chanel’s family isn’t on Instagram. Why? “They don’t see the need of it or understand it and sometimes I wish I was them but got sucked into this world,” Chanel explained.</span></p><p><span>One of Chanel’s brothers is name Sadik, and one of her sisters is supposedly Ifrah Bulter @</span><a href=#><span>ifrah_adventures</span></a><span>.</span></p><p>Talking about Chanel Ayan’s parents, her mother was born in Ethiopia. Meanwhile, her dad was reportedly from Somalia.</p><p><span>Besides them, there’s one special person in this world who Chanel considers her family — her nanny Malika. According to the supermodel, Malika’s been with her for over a decade and she wants her to come with them when they move back to the USA.</span></p><p><b>Did you know:</b><span> It was one of Chanel’s cousins who forced her into the world of modeling.</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Chanel Ayan?</b></h3><p><span>Chanel Ayan was born before 1980. That made her at latest 41 years of age when she appeared on </span><i><span>The Real Housewives of Dubai</span></i><span> in 2022.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Chanel Ayan Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Chanel receives her birthday wishes on June 7.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Where Was Chanel Ayan Born?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Chanel was born in Kenya.
