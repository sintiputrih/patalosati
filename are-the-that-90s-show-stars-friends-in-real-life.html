The show was well-loved by fans, as it perfectly highlighted what life was like for young teenagers growing up in the ‘70s. That ‘70s Show was the beginning of many incredible careers in acting, specifically for stars Mila Kunis, Laura Prepon, Ashton Kutcher, and Wilmer Valderrama. Other stars on the show included Topher Grace and Danny Masterson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, nearly two decades after the hit show came to an end, a sequel series has been created by Netflix. That ‘90s Show tells the story of Leia Forman as she spends a summer in Point Place. The heart of the show is the same, centered around friendships and adolescence. Many original characters returned for cameos, but the teenagers are all new faces. Let’s get into if the That ‘90s Show stars are friends in real life.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Netflix’s That ‘90s Show Promises These Details</a></span></p><h2 id=callie-haverda-and-maxwell-donovan-are-best-friends><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Callie Haverda And Maxwell Donovan Are Best Friends</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Callie Haverda plays the lead of That ‘90s Show as Leia Forman</a>, daughter of Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti. Maxwell Donovan plays Nate, one of the two teenagers who live next door to the Formans. When Leia Forman comes to Point Place to spend the summer with her grandparents, Nate and the rest of the friend group take her in as one of their own and hilarity ensues.</p><p>Though not often paired together on screen, Haverda and Donovan clearly have a great friendship when the cameras are not rolling. While the cast of That ‘90s Show regularly posts each other on social media, it tends to be photos from set or events they all must attend. Haverda, however, has shared many photos of herself and Donovan hanging out outside of work events. Donovan went to Universal Studios amusement park with Haverda, her brother, and her friend back in the summer of 2022. They recently hung out in Park City, Utah following a That ‘90s Show event. Though fans may wish they were secretly in a relationship, Donovan has had a serious girlfriend for over one year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sam-morelos-shares-that-lsquo-90s-show-behind-the-scenes><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sam Morelos Shares That ‘90s Show Behind The Scenes</span></h2><p>There is nothing fans love more seeing behind the scenes moments from their favorite television shows. This is especially true when the snapshots include cameos from original cast members. The That ‘90s Show cast has shared a lot of photos from set, including adorable photos featuring stars from That ‘70s Show when they return to film a guest appearance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Actress Sam Morelos has shared the most behind the scenes content of any of her That ‘90s Show cast mates. Morelos plays Nikki in That ‘90s Show, one of the newer characters to the franchise who hangs out in the Forman basement. Her character is linked to Maxwell Donovan’s Nate, as they play a couple on the show. Morelos is very new to acting, as she only appeared in two short films before landing her role in That ‘90s Show. Since this is her first long-term acting job, it makes sense that she is overly excited to share what her life is like on set. Fans certainly love seeing the cast have so much fun behind the scenes.</p><h2 id=that-lsquo-90s-show-cast-go-to-concerts-together><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>That ‘90s Show Cast Go To Concerts Together</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/that-90s-show.jpg><p>The cast of That ‘90s Show have spent a lot of time together. The filming process of a television show has long hours and can take months to complete, meaning they spent basically every day together during the filming process. It is easy to get sick of someone after spending so much time with them, but that is not the case for the That ‘90s Show stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even after the cameras stop rolling, stars Callie Haverda, Ashley Aufderheide, Mace Coronel, Reyn Doi, Sam Morelos, and Maxwell Donovan still want to hang out with each other. This is because they formed such a strong bond and friendship while filming That ‘90s Show. The cast, specifically Haverda, Donovan, Doi, and Morelos, attended a concert by James Iha, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who composed music for </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">That ‘90s Show</a>, at the Hollywood Bowl in November 2022. This was long after filming for the first season had come to a close, and fans loved that they all still wanted to hang out together.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What That ‘70s Show Cast Thinks Of Netflix’s Reboot, That ‘90s Show</a></span></p><h2 id=mila-kunis-hated-filming-with-husband-ashton-kutcher><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Mila Kunis Hated Filming With Husband Ashton Kutcher</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mila-Kunis-and-Ashton-Kutcher.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That ‘90s Show features an all new cast of teenagers, but many of the original cast members of That ‘70s Show have returned to make guest appearances and cameos in the Netflix sequel series. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp are main characters in the new show, and stars such as Topher Grace and Wilmer Valderrama returned to briefly reprise their roles from That ‘70s Show.</p><p>Celebrities Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher also returned for cameos, but their filming process was not at glorious as others’. Since being on That ‘70s Show in the late 1990s, Kunis and Kutcher reconnected and are now married. They played a couple on the original show, and fans love that they ended up together in real life. While she enjoyed returning to the set, Kunis hated filming with her husband. Not only was <a href=#>she uncomfortable acting alongside someone she knows so well</a>, Kunis felt her character should have been with Valderrama’s character since they ended up together in That ‘70s Show. “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">My husband and I are together in [the new show]</a>, which is weird because we shouldn’t have been,” Kunis told Variety. “You know what, I called B.S. I was like, ‘My character would be with Fez.’</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=that-lsquo-90s-show-cast-travels-together><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>That ‘90s Show Cast Travels Together</span></h2><p>When promoting a television show or film, the cast typically must travel around either the United States or the globe in order to conduct interviews and press days. The process can be quite exhausting, but it is significantly more enjoyable when travelling with best friends. Thankfully, the That ‘90s Show cast are very close and the travel and press is not that horrible.</p><p>The cast of That ‘90s Show have travelled all over the place together to promote the new Netflix original television show. While fans may expect to only see official press photos from their travels and interviews, that is not the case. The cast has documented their fun times together on social media, and the more memorable photos feature the cast enjoying lunch or sitting by the pool together. Their bond is exactly like it is in That ‘90s Show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>That ‘90s Show Fans Worried Randy Would Appear On The Show Instead Of Eric And The Theory Makes Sense</a></span></p><h2 id=reyn-doi-bonded-with-debra-jo-rupp><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Reyn Doi Bonded With Debra Jo Rupp</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/who-has-a-higher-net-worth-debra-jo-rupp-or-kurtwood-smith_.jpg><p>Reyn Doi is the young actor who plays Ozzie on That ‘90s Show. His previous acting credits include the Nickelodeon shows Drama Club and Side Hustle. Doi is only 14 years old, but he was likely just 13 years old while filming That ‘90s Show. Despite his young age, Doi had a remarkable performance on the new <strong><a href=#>Netflix </a></strong>original show during an emotional coming out scene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Doi was paired with actress Debra Jo Rubb for the scene. His character’s goal was to come out to an adult he sees regularly, and he was scared that Rubb’s Kitty Forman would not react well to the news. Doi spoke with People about the emotion scene. “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Being able to work with Debra Jo on such an important scene</a>, I believe, to the show and also to Ozzie’s storyline was really amazing,” Doi said. “And I know that a lot of people came up to me after we had filmed the show [in front of a live audience] that Friday night, and they said, ‘That scene made me really emotional.’ And I still get comments like that today. So, I’m happy that [comes across] on screen.”</p><h2 id=are-the-that-lsquo-70s-show-stars-still-friends><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Are The That ‘70s Show Stars Still Friends?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since That ‘90s Show has just aired on Netflix and the show is very popular, fans are once again talking about That ‘70s Show and its stars. Though it is obvious that some stars still spend a lot of time together—Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher are married, after all—fans wonder how often the rest of the cast gets together and if they are still friends. Fans may remember when Danny Masterson posted several photos on Instagram of That ‘70s Show cast reunions, specifically one in 2016, and yet Topher Grace was not featured in any images.</p><p>Danny Masterson and Ashton Kutcher were very close after That ‘70s Show came to an end. Together they created The Ranch with Netflix, which they both starred in. Many actors from That ‘70s Show joined the Netflix original, including Wilmer Valderrama and Debra Jo Rupp. Unfortunately, Masterson was accused of rape and put on trial. His character was written out of The Ranch and it does not seem like he still hangs out with Kutcher following the scandal. <a href=#>Masterson does not appear in </a><a href=#>That ‘90s Show</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dqbWmedOhmK1laWXAbr%2FHqK5mq6SWv7R5xaugnqaUqHqquoyrnJqkXaG2p7GO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./new-zealand-cat-killing-contest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Children's Cat-Killing Contest Canceled Over Backlash">&larr;
