American by nationality and Caucasian by ethnicity, Amy’s birth puts her under the zodiac sign Capricorn. Amy was raised on a family farm.

Although she did not shy away from getting her hands dirty, Amy had different ideas than to pursue a career in farming and was more focused on academics.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Education:</h2><p>On the education side of things, Amy enrolled at Grove City Area High School and graduated in 1998. She continued on with her studies at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Corey was working as a bouncer to supplement his income as a wrestler which did not yield him much, and Amy worked as a Bartender when not on the road as a BMW spokesmodel. The pair connected instantly, Corey moved in with her after the first week.

Amy <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>accused</a> her husband had been cheating with WWE star, Carmella. The Instagram post read,</p><p>“This may be totally below me to do but I’m hurt. I’m sad. I’ve put 11 years into supporting a man to accomplish his dream only for him to punch me in the gut! ‘I’ve been through suicide attempts, alcoholism, among so much more with him and stuck by his side. The kicker is finding out that he’s been sleeping with one of my daughters role models all along. @carmellawwe and @wwegraves I hope you guys are happy. I really do!”</p><p>Amy has since deleted the post and her Instagram account. While both Graves and Carmella denied the accusations, Amy later revealed that she and Graves had already been living separately leading up to the divorce.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Moving On:</h3><p>After the divorce, Amy found solace in the arms of another man.
