'As' was written as his statement of faith that, like nature, his love will endure as it is the work of God.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Although the song's lyrics have often been interpreted as someone serenading their lover, saying that they'll love them "always" until grandiose acts of physical impossibility come true.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Some of these stated in the lyrics are rainbows burning the stars out in the sky, oceans covering the tops of every mountain, dreaming of life and life becoming a dream, day becoming night and vice versa.</p><h2 class=heading-subtitle><strong>Who helped Stevie record the track?</strong></h2><figure>Stevie Wonder In London. <span class=attribution>Picture: <a href=#>Getty</a></span></figure><p class=paragraph-text>There's a bucket load of musical talent behind the scenes of 'As', and it's not coming from just Stevie Wonder.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Wanting a layered, sleek groove on the keys, he recruited jazz-funk firebrand Herbie Hancock to record a separate track on the Fender Rhodes piano to slot in alongside Stevie's tinkering.</p><p class=paragraph-text>In fact, throughout the entire album Songs In The Key Of Life, over 130 recording artists would be involved including <a href=#>George Benson</a> and <a href=#>Minnie Riperton</a>.</p><p class=paragraph-text>The turnover of contributors was incredibly high as they often couldn’t keep up with Stevie’s work ethic.</p><p class=paragraph-text>He later said: "If my flow is goin', I keep on until I peak."</p><h2 class=heading-subtitle><strong>When was it released?</strong></h2><figure>'As' for the last single released from Songs In The Key Of Life. <span class=attribution>Picture: Tamla</span></figure><p class=paragraph-text>'As' was featured on Songs In The Key Of Life which was released 28th on September, 1976 via Tamla Records, a division of <a href=#>Berry Gordy</a>'s <a href=#>Motown Records</a>.</p><p class=paragraph-text>It was released as a single over a year later in October 1977.</p><h2 class=heading-subtitle><strong>How did it perform in the charts?</strong></h2><figure>Stevie Wonder. <span class=attribution>Picture: <a href=#>Getty</a></span></figure><p class=paragraph-text>'As' only reached No.36 in the Billboard Charts in its peak position, which was outdone by previous singles 'I Wish' and 'Sir Duke'.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Even though it didn't perform as well, the song is still considered to be one of Stevie's greatest accomplishments.</p><h2 class=heading-subtitle><strong>What is the song’s legacy?</strong></h2><figure>Backstage At The Grammy Awards. <span class=attribution>Picture: <a href=#>Getty</a></span></figure><p class=paragraph-text>Songs In The Key Of Life continued selling well over a year after its initial release, thanks to the success of 'As', the final single from the album.</p><p class=paragraph-text>It would go on to win Stevie's his third consecutive Grammy Award for Album Of The Year, and three other Grammy’s along with three other nominations.</p><p class=paragraph-text>The likes of <a href=#>Prince</a> and <a href=#>Sir Elton John</a> have referred to the album as one of their favourites and most influential.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Whilst inducting Stevie into the <a href=#>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in 1989, <a href=#>Bob Dylan</a> himself said: "If anybody can be called a genius, Stevie Wonder can."</p><h2 class=heading-subtitle><strong>Has anyone covered ‘As’?</strong></h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/4wwS49p3uRQ/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>George Michael, Mary J.
