Taking over for iconic '90s Wednesday played by Christina Ricci who so famously burned down a Thanksgiving play in Addams Family Values, is You actress Jenna Ortega. Wednesday introduces us to many fairly <a href=# rel=nofollow>new faces including Hunter Doohan, Joy Sunday, Emma Myers and more</a>.While Christina Ricci appears as a different character in the series, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman take over as Morticia and Gomez Addams. Despite evoking nostalgia for longtime Addams Family fans, <a href=# rel=nofollow>the series is not intended to be a reboot</a>. But, with a renewed interest in the Tim Burton films, we decided to take a look at the actors who starred in The Addams Family movies; here’s what they are doing now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-elizabeth-wilson><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>What Happened To Elizabeth Wilson?</span></h2><p>After playing Abigail Craven in The Addams Family, Elizabeth Wilson starred in many other movies and TV shows including The Boys Next Door (1996), and Rocky Road (2001). After guest starring in an episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent in 2002, she took a 10-year break from the business before playing Mrs. Roosevelt in Hyde Park on Hudson. This would be Elizabeth WIlson’s final role before the Tony Award-winning actress died in 2015 at the age of 94.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-judith-malina><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>What Happened To Judith Malina?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Judith Malina also passed away in 2015</a>, just one month before Wilson died in her home. Before Malina passed, she was credited with several roles after The Addams Family, including a guest appearance on The Sopranos (2006), When In Rome (2010), and her final role was in the 2013 TV movie Over/Under.</p><h2 id=is-jimmy-workman-still-acting><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Is Jimmy Workman Still Acting?</span></h2><p>His portrayal of Pugsley Addams in the movie was Jimmy Workman’s screen debut, but he has since appeared in several other projects. The actor’s resume includes movies like Christmas In Connecticut (1992), As Good As It Gets (1997), and his most recent The Biggest Fan in 2005.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though Jimmy Workman has retired from acting, he still works in the industry as part of the transportation department for various film projects.</p><h2 id=what-is-christopher-hart-doing-now><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>What Is Christopher Hart Doing Now?</span></h2><p>Christopher Hart played Thing, the right hand of the Addams Family in the movies.

Since her debut as Wednesday, in all her ghoulish, snarky glory Christina has had quite the career.</p><p>She is the only cast member from the '90s movies to appear in the new series though the actress has said that working on Wednesday '<a href=# rel=nofollow>didn't really feel like revisiting The Addams Family</a>'.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Plenty Of Fans Blinked And Missed Christina Ricci's Role In The Matrix Resurrections</a></span></p><h2 id=what-is-carel-struycken-doing-these-days><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>What Is Carel Struycken Doing These Days?</span></h2><p>Carel Struycken, who played Lurch in the movies, was already an established actor before The Addams Family. The actor has also had a steady career since, acting in the Star Trek franchise as well as Men in Black (1997).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor's latest project Class of ‘85 was just released earlier this year.</p><h2 id=is-dan-hedaya-still-acting><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Is Dan Hedaya Still Acting?</span></h2><p>Dan Hedaya played Tully Alford, a secondary antagonist in The Addams Family. Among his most notable roles are as Jack Roselli in Shaft (2000), Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016), Gotham (2014-2019), Blue Bloods (2015-2019).

The actor has a very extensive resume which includes guest appearances on NCIS (2020), and The Big Bang Theory (2016). Lloyd, who is now 84, is still booking roles; he appeared in Spirit Halloween and The Conners along with other projects this year, and he’s not done yet.</p><p>He’s set to guest star in an episode of The Mandalorian in 2023, with multiple other projects in production.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>A Big Bang Theory Extra Had A Ten-Hour Day On-Set And Saw Her Role Get Changed At The Last Minute</a></span></p><h2 id=raul-julia-played-gomez-in-the-addams-family><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Raul Julia Played Gomez In The Addams Family</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though Raul Julia was famous for his portrayal of Gomez Addams, he had been acting since 1951. He starred in films like Tempest (1982), The Rookie (1990), and Street Fighter (1994). His last appearance as Gomez was in Addams Family Values in 1993; he died on October 24 1994 of complications from a stroke, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">his last film Street Fighter: The Movie, was released posthumously in 1995</a>.</p><h2 id=what-is-anjelica-huston-doing-now><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What Is Anjelica Huston Doing Now?</span></h2><p>Anjelica Huston in a sense, set the standard for the live-action portrayal of the iconic Morticia Addams.
