Coyotes are generally wary of larger animals, and the sound of a barking dog may signal to them that it's not worth the risk to stick around. However, this is not a foolproof method, and it's important to take precautions to keep both pets and wildlife safe. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HPraClnZujvLi4xJ2enmaTpLpwvsSpq6KklWK9prDImmadp12YvLq7056qZpqRp7hurdNmpaKfmKk%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./does-nashville-have-good-nightlife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does Nashville have good nightlife?">&larr;
