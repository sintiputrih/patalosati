Meet "Jamie!"</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Even as Post Malone has become more and more famous, he has worked hard to keep his relationship private. The singer almost never discusses his partner — who fans refer to as "Jamie" — so very little is known about their relationship.</p><p>However, when he announced the birth of his daughter, he did open up a bit about his personal life.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@aibesam href=#>@aibesam</a><p>Post malone with Jammie <a title=postmalone href=#>#postmalone</a> <a title=gf href=#>#gf</a> <a title=new href=#>#new</a> <a title=newgirlfriend href=#>#newgirlfriend</a> <a title=wife href=#>#wife</a> <a title=engaged href=#>#engaged</a></p><a title="♬ Congratulations - Post Malone" href=#>♬ Congratulations - Post Malone</a></figure><p>"I’m excited for this next chapter in my life. I’m the happiest I’ve ever been, and for since I could remember I was sad," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>. "Time to take care of my body and my family and friends, and spread as much love as we can every day."</p><p>On social media, you can catch glimpses of Post with his future wife, but he has never shared photos of her on his personal Instagram.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Luckily, Post has a great partner when it comes to raising his daughter.</h2><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a> in September 2022, Post revealed that he has played his music for his daughter, but time will tell if she is a fan.</p><p>"She hasn’t cried whenever I put my music on so far, which I think is a good sign, but we’ll wait and find out. I got to let her decide. I tried to play her some stuff but I can’t really tell what she’s into right now. ... I know everybody at the house plays it for her and hopefully, they’ll get stuck in her head. Kids love my music for some reason, which is awesome, so I’m hoping that she just goes with the flow on that one."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>He also described his little girl as "swaggy" and we expect nothing less from Post's offspring.</p><p>"She’s so cool. She’s way cooler than me but she definitely took a little inspiration from me," he added. "Swag by proxy."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Post Malone has been involved in several other relationships in the past.</h2><p>Before becoming a dad with his current partner, the musician was previously linked to concert promoter Ashlen Diaz as well as Korean artist MLMA (short for Me Love Me A Lot).</p><p>Post was even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">taken to court</a> following his breakup with Ashlen by a lawyer who claims that he helped negotiate a settlement between the two at the end of their relationship.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by HipHop Mango (@hiphopmango888)</a></p></figure><p>It may be because his previous relationships were in the public eye that Post has decided to keep his current romantic partnership more private.</p><p>However, we have a feeling Post will introduce fans to his fiancée when he is ready!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpby0wIymmKWnnpp6qLXRpZ2roZWjsQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./j-tash-bio-net-worth-motive-behind-the-murder.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Was J $tash?
