Karin Slaughter, the author of the Will Trent novels, was initially worried about her masterpiece being brought to the screen.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=311 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>However, her concerns were soon put aside following her meeting with Liz Heldens, the executive producer and writer of the series with Daniel T. Thomsen. And the result is now literally in front of our eyes—a magnificent crime drama raking in solid on-air numbers for ABC. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Talking to Newsweek</a>, Slaughter said:</p><p>“I talked to a lot of the writers on set, and they had a sign that says respect the IP, the intellectual property, and they understand that I’ve got 10s of millions of readers and they love the books, and they want to make sure they get the essence of that. So I felt very much included in the process, it’s felt very collaborative.”</p><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=469 data-injectable=true>Slaughter has thus far released 11 books and three novellas in the series, the latest being After That Night, released&nbsp;in June 2023.
