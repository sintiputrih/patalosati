Casts including former </span><i><span>New York Jets</span></i><span> head coach, NFL cheerleaders, ballroom dancers, motivational speakers, and Big Brother season 23 stars, all reeled in more viewers to an already popular show. But amongst them, Lumumba Roberts was just your average language consultant who joined the game to find out how he “fit together” with his wife Glenda.</span></p><p><span>Get to know him better as you scroll below.</span></p><h3><b>Lumumba Roberts On The Amazing Race 34</b></h3><p><span>CBS’s </span><i><span>The Amazing Race</span></i><span> returned for its 34th installment on September 21, 2022, and for the first time in its history, the competition was held outside of the United States, in Munich, Germany.</span></p><p><span>Also, unlike the previous seasons, there were 12 teams (instead of 11) competing for that stunning $1 million cash prize. And not to mention, there were zero non-elimination legs on the season, which was greatly appreciated by longtime fans as well.</span></p><p><span>Super excited for the show’s premiere, Lumumba took it to his IG to share, “WE’RE ON SEASON 34 OF THE AMAZING RACE. LET’S GOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!”</span></p><p><span>In preparation, they watched prior seasons, jotted notes on strategy, and even learned kayaking and rock climbing ― just in case. </span><span>And luckily, they made it past the first round.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, contestants Aastha Lal and Nina Duong (a newly engaged couple from Marina Del Ray, CA) came last in the tasks as rolling a keg of beer through a series of obstacles, sawing through a log to get a clue, and smashing through a huge block of ice with a chisel, and were eliminated.</span></p><p><span>So, the remaining contestants alongside Lumumba and his wife Glenda were Abby Garrett (Data Scientist) and Will Freeman (Accountant), Aubrey Ares (Dance Studio Owner) and David Hernandez (Helicopter Mechanic), Derek Xiao (Product Manager) and Claire Rehfuss (AI Engineer), Emily Bushnell (Law Firm Admin) and Molly Sinert (Healthcare Admin), Luis Colon (Firefighter) and Michelle Burgos (Dancer), Linton (Assistant Principal) and Sharik Atkinson (Masters Student), Marcus (Army Tank Commander) and Michael Craig (Air Force Fighter Pilot), Quinton Peron (Choreographer) and Mattie Lynch (Dance Coach), Tim Mann (Probation Officer) and Rex Ryan (ESPN Analyst), and Rich Kuo (Life Coach) and Dom Jones (Gym Owner).</span></p><h3><b>Glenda And Lumumba Robert’s Relationship</b></h3><p><span>Lumumba Roberts first met Glenda at a church in October 2019. Bonding over their mutual respect for consumer advocate Dave Ramsey, Lumumba then convinced&nbsp; Glenda to meet him at the </span><i><span>Corner Bakery</span></i><span> in Peachtree Corners to talk about “Ramsey-related budgeting tips.”</span></p><p><span>A few days later, they met, but they never talked about Ramsey. Instead, seven-plus hours into their first “date”, they were still talking and Lumumba finally asked for an actual date.</span></p><p><span>So, on their first date (on November 15, 2019), Lumumba took Glenda out to a dance. “He picked me up and I was comfortable with him right away. He was SOOO fun! It was the BEST first date either of us had ever had,” Glenda recalled.</span></p><p><span>Exactly, the next year, Lumumba once again asked Glenda to “bring it,” but this time to wear a gown, and took her to a rooftop restaurant in Midtown Atlanta. There, he, all of a sudden, bent his knee, took out the engagement ring and asked the love of his life to marry him.</span></p><p><span>Finally, in 2021, the couple then exchanged vows and traveled to Jamaica for their honeymoon.</span></p><p><span>Prior to dating Glenda, Lumumba had just come out of a relationship, and ironically, refused to date people within the church.</span></p><h3><b>Lumumba Roberts Age</b></h3><p><span>Lumumba Roberts was 41 years of age when he appeared on</span><i><span> The Amazing Race 34 </span></i><span>in 2022.</span></p><p><span>He is the same as his wife Glenda.</span></p><h3><b>Lumumba Roberts Job</b></h3><p><span>Lumumba Roberts is a consultant who goes by the name “The EPIC Educator.”</span></p><p><span>With over 16 years of experience in the education of every grade level from kindergarten to college, Lumumba has overseen programs that achieved 100% increases in at-risk students’ Language Arts proficiency test scores.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Prior to working independently, Lumumba took the job of a “Language Arts Instructor” at </span><i><span>DeKalb County School District</span></i><span> for a year and an “HS Language Arts/ ESOL Teacher/ Literacy Specialist” at </span><i><span>Gwinnett InterVention Education (GIVE) Center East</span></i><span> for over 4 years.</span></p><p><span>Even outside the classroom, Lumumba is passionate about teaching moms and dads who are stressed out about their children’s future skills, so they can enjoy learning, avoid unnecessary debt, and earn a great living after graduation!</span></p><h3><b>Is Lumumba Roberts On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span>Find Lumumba on Instgram @</span><a href=#><span>robertsfamily365</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, here’s his TikTok @</span><a href=#><span>robertsfamily365</span></a><span> and Facebook @</span><a href=#><span>Lumumba</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Lumumba Roberts Height</b></h3><p><span>Lumumba Roberts stands tall at a height of 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm) and is 8 inches (20 cm) shorter than his wife Glenda.</span></p><p><span>Mentioning his distinct features, Lumumba has brown eyes and dark hair, and he looks a lot like the actor Kevin Hart. Even Glenda agrees, “He looks like him, he sounds like him.”</span></p><h3><b>Lumumba Roberts Family</b></h3><p><span>Lumumba Roberts didn’t reveal his family.</span></p><p><span>However, we do know that Lumumba has a sister named Zelaya who wrote the romantic drama novel </span><i><span>Unconditional</span></i><span>. She is also the mother of the child actress Kingston A. Zelaya.</span></p><p><span>Zelaya had her daughter with her ex Hector Zelaya.</span></p><p><span>Supporting Lumumba, Zelaya took it to her FB @</span><a href=#><span>princessmbalu</span></a><span> to share the clip from </span><i><span>The Amazing Race 34 </span></i><span>captioned, “Watching my brother and sister-in-law on The Amazing Race • Can you tell we’re excited.”</span></p><p><span>Also, Lumumba’s parents-in-law are Glenn and Cynthia Matthews</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Lumumba Roberts From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Lumumba hails from Stone Mountain, Georgia.</span></p><p><span>But as of 2022, he resided in Norcross, GA.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Lumumba Robert’s Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Lumumba celebrates his birthday on December 3 and is of the Sagittarius zodiac.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Where Did Lumumba Roberts Recieve His Education?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Lumumba attended </span><i><span>Morehouse College</span></i><span> from 1999 to 2003 for his B.A. in history degree.
