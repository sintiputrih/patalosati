Even if he "can't say what the future holds" in terms of his relationship with Beth, the 'Lifetime' personality continued, "But I know I will be a stronger version of myself regardless."</p><p>On the ninth season of '<a href=#>Married at First Sight</a>,' the couple got hitched in 2019. On the 'Lifetime' reality show, the "strangers" couple briefly met at the altar before saying "I do." At the conclusion of filming, they chose to remain together despite several dramatic blowout arguments. They relocated to San Francisco and later moved to Colorado together after filming the series in North Carolina, as reported by <a href=# rel=nofollow>US Weekly</a>.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=#>'Married At First Sight': Were Jamie and Elizabeth high during their nasty fight? Fans say they spotted a bong</a></p><p><a href=#>Here's a look at the 'Married At First Sight' couples that are STILL together</a></p><h2 class=split>'Taking some time away from my wife'</h2><p>"A lot of you have been asking and I‚Äôve been avoiding the questions‚Ä¶ So, I just wanted to share that I‚Äôm taking some time away from my wife to focus on myself and my personal growth. It's not easy, but it's necessary," 39-year-old Thompson wrote on Instagram on Saturday, April 22.</p><p>Thompson made it clear in his Instagram announcement that this separation is in his best interests: "Taking this step may be difficult, but I know it's necessary for me to become the best version of myself. I can‚Äôt say what the future holds for Beth and I, but I know I will be a stronger version of myself regardless."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/a0f237a6-8fe1-475c-a4b9-68505b38c2a2.jpg><p>In response to questions regarding the split, Thompson shared in his Instagram story that Bice, 36, was the one who left him following a heated argument. "At first it was not [a mutual separation]. Beth was actually the first one to leave," the tech expert claimed on Saturday. "The fighting had gotten really bad ‚Äî I‚Äôm not going to lie ‚Äî and I said a lot of things that I really should not have said. I said them out of anger and frustration. But I also haven‚Äôt felt like I‚Äôve had any reciprocation back of how to fix this and how to move forward, so she‚Äôs been gone for four weeks. I think at this point it‚Äôs better for me to focus on myself and trying to become a better version of myself, honestly," Thompson continued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/ce6b55db-02a9-4e35-82e2-f06768bdd558.jpg><p>Fans were certainly stunned by the 'MAFS' season 9 star's social media posts since the North Carolina duo recently celebrated four years of marriage on March 23. "Happy 4 years babe!" Elizabeth posted photos from the wedding as strangers on Instagram along with the statement, saying, "It‚Äôs hard to believe we did something so crazy that changed our lives forever a whole 4 years ago. I sometimes forget we met on a TV show because life seems so right with you in it! I love us and I love our life together! Happy anniversary!!!!!!!! Thank you for everyone that follows and is part of our journey!"</p><h2 class=split>'You got this brotha'</h2><p>Fans quickly took to the comment section to show their support for the now-separated couple from MAFS. One fan related with their experience and wrote, "I recently did this. Four months in my own place, both of us in individual counseling + marriage counseling, date nights, and lots of time alone. After four months we are living together again and stronger than ever. It was terrifying, important, and could have ended in so many ways - but I knew we would be better because of the chance we took‚Ä¶separate or together. We have been together for 31 years and I can‚Äôt wait for the next three decades. Good luck to both you & Beth. It‚Äôs a brave thing you are doing. üôåüëè" A second fan wrote, "You got this brotha. It‚Äôs always gotta be ‚Äúme before we‚Äù coz in order to give someone your best you need to be at your best ü´∂üèΩ" Another 'MAFS' star, Shawniece L Jackson wrote, "Wishing you both the best love and support ‚ù§Ô∏è" Someone else commented, "You can‚Äôt be a good partner if you can‚Äôt be a good you. Best of luck to you both. Every marriage has very rough spots. It can make you stronger if you let it."</p><h2 class=split>'They fought a lot'</h2><p>As per <a href=#>MEAWW</a>, on Season 9 of "MAFS," Elizabeth Bice, a businesswoman, and influencer, was partnered with Jamie Thompson, a senior technical consultant at the cloud content management startup Box. Even though the pair insists that they were always eager, to be honest and upfront about their feelings on television, we all know that this is code for "they fought a lot".&nbsp;</p><p>It was their day, and Thompson believed that by making everything about herself, she was being self-centered and&nbsp;shallow. Later, she did explain that she had a right to enjoy all the particulars because she was the bride. Bice insisted that she didn't want to dispute and just wanted Thompson to leave as he proceeded to correct her. Then he declared that he was quitting this marriage if he went. She then reacted, "Okay, bye." Fans believed that Jamie's decision to leave after packing his bags was the last blow. But as they soon found each other again, it was far from over for these two.</p><p>When you take a glance at either of their Instagram accounts, it's difficult to imagine that these two lovers went through the chaos they did throughout their season. The couple used to do a lot of outdoor things together, enjoy time with their dogs, and were never afraid to cuddle up. It's endearing to see them acting this way, especially when Jamie once said he was unsure whether Bice considered him attractive or not. However, they frequently referred to one another as their "man crush Mondays" and "woman crush Wednesdays," and it was wonderful to watch them develop their relationship.</p><p>This article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations.
