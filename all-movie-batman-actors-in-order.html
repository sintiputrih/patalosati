Over that time he’s seen countless adventures in comic books, video games and on television, but it’s the silver screen that’s cemented him as a bona fide pop culture icon.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=74 data-current-count=74 data-injectable=false>So, without further ado, let’s list these cinematic caped crusaders!</p><h2 id=h-lewis-wilson data-injectable=false>Lewis Wilson</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>Gotham’s Dark Knight fights crime in a sweatsuit and a balaclava. The evil Asian villain is played by a white guy who would <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">later get Hollywood legend James Hong fired</a> from a movie for being too Asian. The guys doing the titles aren’t sure if “Batman” is one word or two.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=495 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>All this and more can be found in 1943’s Batman, the first of Bruce Wayne’s big-screen, live-action adventures. Our first Batman came to us via Lewis Wilson, a 23-year-old working actor whose career never peaked higher than the “played the first Batman” footnote. Featuring high melodrama and exactly the kind of racism that you’re probably imagining, Batman was released in 15 chapters between July and October of 1943. At 260 minutes in length it <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">still feels shorter than The Batman</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Robert Lowery</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=635 data-injectable=true>In 1949, Batman returned to theaters in Batman and Robin, another 15-part serial. Produced by Sam Katzman – think World War II-era <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Roger Corman</a> – it was cheap, messy, poorly thought out, but kinda fun. This time, 36-year-old Robert Lowery stepped into the lumpy bat suit, going toe-to-toe with an evil inventor called the Wizard.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Adam West</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=676 data-current-count=976 data-injectable=true>There’s not much in the world that’s more fun than the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adam West</a> Batman series. Chaotically campy and played with a straight-faced earnestness, it’s joyfully goofy. For this iteration’s theatrical film, the CBS Batman show’s main cast returned, along with a good chunk of the rogues’ gallery. Frank Gorshin’s Riddler, Burgess Merideth’s Penguin, and Cesar Romero’s Joker all turned up to chew scenery, while an otherwise occupied Julie Newmar was replaced by Lee Meriwether. The 1966 motion picture remains worth watching nearly 60 years later, and will have you wondering why more evil plans don’t end in the arms of the Penguin’s exploding octopus.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Michael Keaton</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>A full five decades after the Batman was introduced in the pages of Detective Comics, it was time for fans to put away childish things, focusing on a version of their favorite superhero who was just for big boys. Following Frank Miller’s lead, Tim Burton tried to leave the goofiness of ‘60s-era Batman behind him, giving audiences the first full-throated interpretation of the character in a high-budget movie.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>He chose Michael Keaton for the part. Fans were not happy, reportedly sending tens of thousands of angry letters to Warner Bros – an almost quaint amount of complaining by today’s standards, but that’s what things were like back when you had to pay postage every time you wanted to send an angry tweet.</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=true>Keaton’s debut was a monster hit, but he bowed out after 1992’s Batman Returns when the studio decided to move in a less emotionally traumatizing direction and canned Burton.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Val Kilmer</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>Among the briefest tenures in Batman movie history, Val Kilmer only defended the streets of Gotham once, during Joel Schumacher’s Batman Forever in 1995. He would go on to give many reasons for leaving the franchise, as would other people involved in the project.</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kilmer said</a> that he felt unappreciated in the role, and that he couldn’t connect with a character who punches all of his problems away. Schumacher said that Kilmer got into a shoving match with him on set.&nbsp;Bad vibes all round. Oh well, next time Schumacher will nail it… right?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>George Clooney</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=586 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>The only Batman actor ever to offer to personally refund anyone that saw his movie in theaters, George Clooney took over the role for 1997’s Batman and Robin, a film that’s aged like a fine wine someone opened a glowstick into. Still hot off of the success of ER, Clooney didn’t have much to do in the flick. He mostly stood, stiffly, not turning his head very much. He’s nobody’s favorite Batman. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Not even his own</a>. Not even Brad Pitt’s, probably.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Christian Bale&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>With another decade of goofiness in the rearview, Christopher Nolan pulled a hard reset on Batman, bringing realism (relative to mid-2000s superhero movies) to the franchise. For his series, he’d need an intense, dramatically charged actor – the kind that could sell even the weirdest lines of dialogue from American Psycho, or Newsies, or whatever.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>Christian Bale became a generation’s favorite Batman in 2005’s Batman Begins, finally presenting the character as scarred, traumatized, and obsessed with justice to an unhealthy degree. His interpretation proved so popular, that it contributed to WB’s decision to stay out of the MCU-adjacent shared universe model of filmmaking until Bale’s solo Dark Knight story was over.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Ben Affleck</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=201 data-injectable=false>Nerds of a certain age will never forget where they were the day that DC announced that Ben Affleck would be their shared universe’s new Batman. Some of us went “ew.” Others went “huh.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=607 data-injectable=true>If Christian Bale’s Batman poked moodily at his oatmeal, Affleck’s threw his bowl across the room and screamed that he wanted Apple Jacks. He was a cranky, angry Batman, branding the criminals that he took down with pictures of his favorite animal. He wasn’t for everybody. Heck, by the end, he wasn’t even for Affleck, who was openly exhausted with the role by the time The Flash came out in 2022.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Robert Pattinson</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>Taking a step back from trying to make their own MCU, DC released The Batman in 2022, a sort of spiritual successor to the Batman of the Nolan/Bale era. Divorced of shared universe malarkey, he was a young, humorless Batman, all about punching, gravelly voices, and moody Nirvana covers.</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>Time being a flat circle, DC elected to keep this Batman off in his own universe being moody while they make plans for a different Batman to do group projects with. It was like 2005 through 2012 all over again.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Michael Keaton again</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>Nostalgia sells, right? Michael Keaton returned to the cape and cowl for The Flash, playing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">kind-of-sort-of the same Batman</a> that he’d played in Batman and Batman Returns. Early reports had his Bruce Wayne taking over as the DCEU’s Nick Fury analogue, and Keaton had already shot scenes for the studio’s Batgirl film before it was historically and unceremoniously scrapped. The Flash turned out to be an embarrassing disaster. Let’s just hope Keaton got a good payday.</p><p data-characters=148 data-current-count=148 data-injectable=false>The further adventures of ‘80s Bruce Wayne are doomed to remain unfilmed, but you can read about them in the pages of the comic book Batman ‘89.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>George Clooney again</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>For one glorious, perfect moment in the final frames of 2023’s The Flash, everything made perfect sense. The universe was scrambled by time travel. Everything was weird. Zack Snyder’s obsession with having heroes drop F-bombs finally, just for a second, fit perfectly into the events that occurred on screen. George Clooney’s Batman was back. What the f…</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=748 data-injectable=false>Shot as a bit on the recommendation of new studio co-head James Gunn and representing the troubled picture’s third or fourth ending, The Flash’s final scene sees George Clooney brought back to screens. Canon-wise, it’s unlikely to mean anything moving forward, but darned if it wasn’t an enormous swing by a company that knew that it was about to start over from scratch anyway.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTpLqqr8GopqSrX5a5rXnMqK2inV2XrrW5wKdkmpukpL%2B0ecinZKiqlJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./marvel-snap-best-decks-for-beginners.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Marvel Snap: best decks for beginners">&larr;
