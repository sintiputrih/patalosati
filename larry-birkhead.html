His height is 1.8 meters and his weight is 75 kilograms.</p><h2>Career</h2><p><strong>Larry Birkhead</strong> began his career by appearing in and participating in a variety of television shows.

Wife Swap, Life after Anna on E! Network, Entertainment Tonight, The Millionaire Matchmaker, Inside Edition, Access Hollywood, Wendy Williams Show, Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry, RTL Television, and Steve Harvey were among the many TV shows he and Dannielynn appeared on. Though many men, including Mark Hatten, Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt, Howard K. Stern, and Smith’s former bodyguard Alexander Denk, challenged paternity, a DNA test provided by Michael L. Baird revealed that Birkhead had indeed fathered Smith’s infant daughter, later named Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern.</p><p>Furthermore, Smith claimed that his lawyer and business partner, Stern, was the father. In 2007, a Bahamian court ordered that custody of Dannielynn be transferred to Birkhead from Stern, who changed her birth certificate to show him as her father and renamed her Dannielynn Hope Marshall Birkhead.</p><p>Smith’s mother, Virgie Arthur, has registered for Dannielynn’s care and attempted to prevent Birkhead from leaving the country with the child. A Bahamas magistrate in the Court of Appeals in Nassau has dismissed Virgie Arthur’s appeal and ordered her to pay $3000 in legal fees.</p><h2>Achievements and Awards</h2><p><strong>Larry Birkhead’s</strong> success is being shared with Anna Nicole Smith, a Playboy model from the United States.
