So if you're wondering what <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the best school to attend is if you want to party</a> hard, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the Princeton Review's annual list of party schools</a> has just been released. And <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the top party school of 2015</a> is...drum roll, please... The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign! This branch of U of I is located in Champaign, Illinois; according to the university itself, it "has a rich, committed history to teaching, research, and public engagement." Well, the Princeton Review can definitely confirm the latter to be true.</p><p>If you're wondering how <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the Princeton Review's party school ranking</a> came to be, the first list was released in 1993 with Tulane taking the top spot. Other publications have released similar kinds of lists since, but none has been able to duplicate the same sort of viral power as the Princeton Review's. The qualifications that go into deciding which colleges make the rankings is survey-based, asking students questions related to their drinking and study habits, as well as <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the popularity of Greek life</a> at that particular university. Granted, sororities and fraternities are often stereotyped for being party-oriented; furthermore, just because you're not studying doesn't mean you're partying, so take the results with a grain of salt.</p><p>That said, though, if partying is what you hope to get out of your college experience, the Princeton Review might be a good place to start. Check out the top 10 here, and head over to the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Princeton Review for all 20 top party schools of 2015</a>.</p><h3>1. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</h3><p>Although we already know that UIUC is <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the country's top party school,</a> here's a bit more relevant info: The university has over 32,000 students enrolled, all of whom boast some pretty solid average SAT scores (the average student scored a 740 on the math portion of the exam). It's also been in a few other Princeton lists, including <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Best Schools in the Midwest</a>.</p><h3>2. University of Iowa</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Gregory Shamus/Getty Images Sport/Getty Images</p></figure><p>The University of Iowa came in the number two spot. Another school with an intelligent student body who like to party a lot on the side, the average student at UI has a high school GPA of 3.6. The campus is a small urban environment with a strong sports culture, which probably accounts for at least some of the partying. "If there’s one thing that undergrads tend to agree on, it’s that 'life is pretty fun at <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the University of Iowa,</a>'" a student told the Princeton Review.</p><h3>3. University of Wisconsin-Madison</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Andy Manis/Getty Images News/Getty Images</p></figure><p>This school is actually one of the most prestigious in the Midwest; indeed, the Princeton Review calls it one of <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the top public universities</a> in the nation. The school only has a 50 percent admissions rate, but also manages to rankn number one on the Lots of Beer list. They're known for being LGBTQ friendly, and the students have a reputation for being laid back. “Students don't really have to <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>try to fit in</a>” at Madison, because “there's a niche for everyone,” a student said to the Prineton Review.</p><h3>4. Bucknell University</h3><p>This Pennsylvania school is another hard-to-get-into school with a 31 percent acceptance rate. It's also noted by the Princeton Review for having a very <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>active Greek life </a>body and an active student body who is involved in a variety of student organizations and activities.</p><h3>5. Syracuse University</h3><p>The university itself practically admits that students are partying hard, as officials told the Princeton Review that the school "provides students with the triple threat of a great reputation, incredible academic programs, and a great social scene.” An undergrad told the publication that students here are known for maintaining <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>a healthy work/life balance</a> — at least they care about something other than beer!</p><h3>6. University of California-Santa Barbara</h3><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>UC Santa Barbara</a> has a very strong presence in the sciences; many of its students tend to go into STEM fields. According to a student The Princeton Review spoke to, students are very <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>active in campus life</a> in addition to taking care of their academics. “The typical student is active and involved. Whether it be with sports, or in a community service or environmental club, rock climbing, politics, the list goes on. Students fit in by finding a good group of friends in the dorms and by getting involved in extracurricular activities," the student said. Does beer pong count as a sport?</p><h3>7. West Virginia University</h3><p>One student described this school as being “a relaxed, social, and extremely <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>school-spirited environment</a>." A party-rich environment also makes sense; students described the university's population to be "outgoing" and "social."</p><h3>8. University of Georgia</h3><p>This school's student body is made up of 26,000 students who "like to have a good time," but also keep their heads on straight. "<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>The typical student at UGA</a> is one who knows how and when to study but allows himself or herself to have a very active social life," one student said.</p><h3>9. Tulane University</h3><p>Tulane is one of "<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the most respected" universities in the country</a>; it also recognizes that learning isn't limited to the classroom. "Much of the learning that takes place in college happens when students pursue interests outside of class. Such learning plays an important role in the Tulane experience," the school told the Princeton Review. Students said the school was "well rounded" and home to many "<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>liberal and opinionated" students.</a></p><h3>10. Colgate University</h3><p>Colgate is known for being academically demanding, so maybe students there need to let off some steam with some partying after their all-night study sessions. As one student put it, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>"Colgate University</a> has an amazing campus with people who work hard and have goals but also know<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> how to have a really fun time</a>.”</p><p>Images: <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Syracuse University</a>, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>UCSB</a>, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Illinois1987</a>, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Bucknell University </a>, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>West Virginia University</a>, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>The University of Georgia </a>, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Tulane</a>, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Colgate University</a>/Instagram</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyfJBybnJlpJ2ybsDOqWRqaF2lrrPA2GaqnKCfpLm0ecCcmqiqlJ67qHnTqGStoJVivbO1zZycraeeYr%2BmwsiermavmaG5brTEpadmsZ%2Bqeqe1zZ1kraCVYq%2Bmv9M%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./vanessa-angel-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-579705-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vanessa Angel Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
