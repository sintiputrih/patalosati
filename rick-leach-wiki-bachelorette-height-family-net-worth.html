Obviously! Michelle was surprised as she opened the lid.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to Rick, he was the “main course”, and chose to remain inside the meal cart throughout most of the night. Some viewers were creeped out by the stunt but many appreciated his tenancy to make a strong first impression.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Rick might have stood out from the rest with his unforgettable entrance, but he failed to get Michelle’s first impression rose.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>If you don’t know, <a href=#>Nayte Olukoya</a> was the first one to steal Michelle’s first impression rose. He also went on to be one of the two participants to get 1-on-1 dates with Michelle in Minnesota.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This season, Rick was joined by 29 other contestants including Alec Thompson, <a href=#>Brandon Jones</a>, Casey Woods, <a href=#>Clayton Echard</a>, Joe Coleman, Mollique Johnson, Nayte Olukoya, <a href=#>Rodney Matthews</a>, Bryan Witzmann, Jack Russell, JoMarri Gable, Ryan Fox, and many more handsome lads.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>After his stint at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Bachelorette</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, Rick took it to his IG on Sept 29, 2021, to write, “So I went on this show called the Bachelorette and got to meet this amazing woman @michelleyoung. She could be the one.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>There were many contestants this season who had ulterior motives, but Rick wasn’t one of them. Though he may not have been able to steal the bachelorette’s heart, he certainly gained a lot of fans with his head-on-a-plate stunt and humorous personality.</span></p><h3><b>Rick Leach Ideal Partner</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>ABC described Rick Leach as a “self-proclaimed hopeless romantic who has been thinking about his future wife for as long as he can remember.” They also added that he was the type of guy to send you flowers to his partner at work for no reason but to say, “I love you.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, for a guy who wears his heart on his sleeve, Rick’s ideal partner would be someone who would love him back like the way he does or at least appreciates his efforts. He wanted someone “who can make the world a better place” and be his heart’s true counterpart.</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Rick Leach?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Rick Leach was born on April 15, 1989. That made him 32 years of age in 2021 when he first appeared on Michelle Young’s season of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Bachelorette</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Corresponding to his birthday, Rick is of the Aries zodiac.</span></p><h3><b>Rick Leach Height</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>This handsome man Rick Leah stands tall at a height of above 6 feet (183 cm).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mentioning his distinct features, Rick has hazel eyes, a long triangular face, and a ripped body.</span></p><h3><b>Rick Leach Family</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Rick Leach is open about his family. He shared that his parents were his greatest inspiration, and sacrificed a great deal for their children. Talking about his mother (who was a kindergarten teacher), Rick said that she has the energy of a 6-year-old on a sugar high and this is probably why she is an amazing teacher.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, he added that she always has been his number 1 supporter, and a better dancer than him.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Unfortunately, Rick’s father Rick Leach Sr. passed away in October 2018. “He taught me how to be a great person, how to enjoy life, and how to compete. I love that man with all my heart,” Rick recalled his father.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now and then, Rick often reminisced the days with his dad over his IG. According to him, the two shared beers, talked about sports, and always put smiles on each other faces.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Even after his death, Rick remembered him on Father’s Day every year. Likewise, Rick’s mother was often seen over his IG on Mother’s Day.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for Rick’s siblings, he has a brother named Sean Leach @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>srleach22</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>. The two brothers were often seen together at family gatherings or any occasion.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Rick’s family lived in Memphis as of 2021.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400><strong>Trivia:</strong> Rick has a nephew cousin named Leah Leach, a </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Belmont University</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> graduate.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Rick Leach Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Rick Leach garnered a net worth of above $250 thousand by 2021.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Though Rick might not be a healthcare professional, he was someone who loved working in the healthcare industry. He enjoyed working with other providers, their staff and patients, and found it “extremely rewarding.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As of 2021, Rick was working as a senior sales representative for </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Bioventus</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> for almost 3 years. Before that, he worked with </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Poplar Healthcare</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> as a territory manager for almost 2 years.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Rick was associated with </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Advanced Health and Wellness Center</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>VanDevere Chevrolet</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in Ohio.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In light of his education, Rick went to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Walsh University, DeVille School </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>of Business for his Bachelor in Arts from 2010 to 2013. Later, he then joined </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Loyola Marymount University</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> for his Master’s degree in Business Administration and graduated in 2021.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Besides these, Rick is also a professional model. He claimed to have modeled for over 3 years, and have experience in runway, commercial, video commercial, and acting. “My goals are to be in a bigger market, make steps to making a name for myself, and to learn how to become better every day,” he shared.</span></p><p><b>Did you know:</b><span style=font-weight:400> In 2014, Rick appeared in an indie movie called </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Curator</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Is Rick Leach On Instagram, Facebook?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, find him on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>rickleachjr</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>His Facebook account wasn’t shared.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Where Is Rick Leach From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Rick hails from Cleveland, Ohio, US.</span></p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmq6GToHqtscCcn2avmaC2bq7AnJ%2BepJ%2BnsrXAxGafnqGXncFussCmoKWxXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./british-royal-family-tree.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The British Royal Family Tree: a who's who of the monarchy">&larr;
