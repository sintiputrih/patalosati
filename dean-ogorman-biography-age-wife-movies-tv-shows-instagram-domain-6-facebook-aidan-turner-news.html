Cardy, he admitted to having difficulty finding work during his first year in Los Angeles.&nbsp;He was almost broke, but was soon discovered by his friend’s agent and so began to receive more work, dividing his time between painting, photography and acting.</span></p><p><span>In 2012, he held his first exhibition at the Page Blackie Gallery in Wellington, New Zealand, from June 19-23.&nbsp;The theme of the exhibition was centered on the Vietnam War.&nbsp;In order to get the accuracy of his work, O’Gorman sought the advice of a New Zealand Vietnam veteran.&nbsp;Preferring to dress and edit shoots himself, models in this gallery included fellow cast members from The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and The Almighty Johnsons.&nbsp;O’Gorman’s photographs were exhibited at the B3 Biennale in Berlin in 2015.</span></p><p><span>Dean O’Gorma</span></p><h2><strong><span>DEAN O’GORMAN SHORT STORIES</span></strong></h2><h4><span>Westside: Return of New Zealand’s favorite crime family</span></h4><p><span class=skimlinks-unlinked><span>Stuff.co.nz-June 27</span></span><span>&nbsp;, 2018</span></p><p><span>It’s time to call in the big guns as West Side returns, badder than ever.&nbsp;Looking at Antonia Prebble’s mullet style hairdo, it’s hard to believe it’s not her real hair.</span></p><p><span>Sitting in the boardroom at South Pacific Pictures in West Auckland, where local drama Westside is filmed, Prebble wears a fluffy bathrobe and heavy makeup.&nbsp;She’s on a break between filming scenes featuring her character, family matriarch Rita West.&nbsp;Beneath her dress, she is dressed in clothing that is meant to reflect West Auckland 1983 – the region and year in which the show is set.</span></p><p><span>‘Surprisingly, my hairdresser said four or five people asked for Rita’s mullet hairstyle.’&nbsp;– Antonia Prebble.&nbsp;Westside, a comedy-drama about a crime family and their friends, is now in its fourth season.&nbsp;The prequel series Outrageous Fortune also stars David de Lautour as Rita’s husband Ted and Will Hall as mustachioed police officer Mike McCarthy.</span></p><p><span>The show’s promotional posters usually show Prebble wearing a stern expression and tight, dark clothing and, of course, the infamous mullet wig.&nbsp;‘Surprisingly, my hairdresser said four or five people asked for Rita’s mullet hairstyle,’ laughs Prebble, whose real hair is a brown bob.&nbsp;The 34-year-old actor has been on the show since its debut when its first season was set in the 1970s.</span></p><p><span>Much has been made of how the series reflects notable events in New Zealand history, such as the 1981 Springbok tour.</span></p><p><span>So what can we expect this year?</span></p><p><span>“Of all the seasons we’ve done, I think this one most resembles the style of Outrageous Fortune,” Prebble says.</span></p><p><span>She insists that these latest episodes are her favorites so far.</span></p><p><span>“This time it’s actually more character-focused,” she says.</span></p><p><span>“Of course, we’re set in a time – it’s 1983. There are still some historical references, but it’s mostly characters, so as a result, it feels a bit more serialized like Outrageous has. and (Wests) house is just busy and full of people all the time.&nbsp;Westside doesn’t have to be hinged on anything other than itself.&nbsp;‘</span></p><p><span>Fans of the show are eagerly awaiting the wedding of Rita Wolf’s (Reef Ireland) son to Cheryl (Ashleigh Cummings).&nbsp;Rita and Cheryl openly dislike each other, though Prebble implies that Rita is making an effort.</span></p><p><span>“This year, she actively tolerates Cheryl in the house, and at some point they are bound by tragedy,” Prebble says.</span></p><p><span>‘But after that they come back to life as usual – which means they’re not each other’s best friends, but they’re kind of on the same team now.’</span></p><p><span>Rima Te Wiata (The Breaker Upperers), Ilona Rodgers (Gloss), and Nicole Whippy (Outrageous Fortune, Nothing Trivial), among others, make appearances on the show.</span></p><p><span>Grant Kereama, the former Lotto host who hosts a radio show in Wellington with his now ex-wife Polly Gillespie, also has a guest role.&nbsp;For Prebble, who grew up in the capital, having Kereama on set was a huge deal.</span></p><p><span>“I was so excited,” she says.&nbsp;“I grew up listening to Grant and Polly.&nbsp;He’s the nicest person.</span></p><p><span>“I was interviewed by him a few times, but it was only by phone, so I hadn’t met him.</span></p><p><span>“But he is so famous.&nbsp;We were like, “Oh my god.&nbsp;Grant Kereama is on our show.&nbsp;»</span></p><p><span>Outside of acting, Prebble is an ambassador for Auckland’s department store Smith & Caughey’s.&nbsp;Last year, she qualified as a wedding officiant because it would be a “good thing to have as a job between acting jobs.”</span></p><p><span>So far, she has only officiated at one wedding due to her busy schedule.</span></p><p><span>“But I have quite a few booked, so my next one is in August, then I have a few at the end of the year and even a few for next year and even 2020,” she says. .&nbsp;“I had to say to these people, ‘Look, I have no idea what life is going to be like then, but we’re going to pencil it in.’&nbsp;I won’t give the date to anyone else if I could, but let’s talk about it in 18 months.&nbsp;»</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiqnqN7r7OOnZyapl2ktLC%2BzJqlZpqZpLSzrc%2BhsGaZl5p6uLXFnmSmp6aesrR5069krKCfrMButc2sq5qfopa6brDOppiipo9reqetwp6ZqKebYq6qsMCnZK2toqOys3nNnq6sZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./drew-brees.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Drew Brees">&larr;
