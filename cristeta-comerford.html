Some of Comerford’s recipes can be found in The New Filipino Kitchen: Stories and Recipes from Around the World.</p><h2><span id=Cristeta_Comerford-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings>Cristeta Comerford- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings</span></h2><p>Before moving to the United States at the age of 23, Cristeta Comerford completed a course in food technology in the Philippines. She eventually obtained naturalization status and began her career as an American chef by working at hotels close to Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport.

In her family, she was the second-youngest child. Her mother, Erlinda Gomez, was a dressmaker, and her father, Honesto Pasia, was a principal of a school.</p><p>Comerford recalled that as a child, her mother was a superb cook who taught her daughters to value fine cooking. Fresh ingredients from Comerford’s grandparents’ farm were frequently available to the family.</p><h2><span id=Education_Details>Education Details</span></h2><p>Comerford attended the University of the Philippines-Diliman to study food technology. Because her brother, Juanito Pasia, was already employed in the United States, she went before finishing her degree.

As the field of candidates was narrowed down, she stayed in the race and showcased her skills by managing the cuisine at a dinner in July 2005 for the visiting prime minister of India. Comerford was appointed as the new executive chef of the White House by Laura Bush the following month.</p><p>Comerford was the first woman, a person of Asian ancestry, and a person of color to hold the position of executive chef in the White House. Additionally, she was the first executive chef to receive a promotion from the White House kitchen.</p><p>Comerford remained in his position as executive chef after Barack Obama was elected president. Soon after First Lady, Michelle Obama put in a garden on the White House lawn, Comerford started modifying her meal to make the most of the recently harvested ingredients. Comerford previously told CNN, “We have gorgeous food growing practically in our backyard, screaming our name and saying “Hey, I’m ready to be prepared today.”</p><p>President Obama commended Comerford as one of the many Filipino-Americans who contribute to the United States when he attended a state banquet in the Philippines in 2014. Comerford remained in his position as a chief chef after Obama’s two years in office, serving under both Donald Trump and Joe Biden.</p><p>As the White House executive chef, Comerford qualified for membership in the Club des Chefs, a network of chefs serving presidents, royalty, and prime ministers.
