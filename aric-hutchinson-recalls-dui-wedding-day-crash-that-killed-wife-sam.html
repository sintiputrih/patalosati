It’s kind of foggy, out of sorts,” Hutchinson told ABC correspondent Eva Pilgrim. “I could see my mom’s face, and you could just tell that something was wrong. I asked her, ‘Where’s Sam? Where’s Sam?’ And that’s when she told me there was an incident and that Sam didn’t make it.”</p><p>Aric, 36, and Samantha, 34, were riding in a golf cart with family members from their wedding reception at Folley Beach when a Toyota Camry allegedly doing 40 mph above the speed limit rear-ended their slow-moving vehicle.</p><p>The impact sent the golf cart flying 100 yards and rolling over several times.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Aric Hutchinson gave an emotional interview to ABC’s “Good Morning America” about last month’s crash that killed his wife just hours after their wedding. <span class=credit>ABC</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">Hutchinson revealed that he initially did not know that his wife, Samantha, was killed when he woke up in the hospital. <span class=credit>9th Judicial Circuit, South Carolina</span></figure><p>The bride, who was still in her wedding dress, died at the scene.</p><p>The groom was <a href=#>hospitalized with a brain injury</a> and multiple broken bones in his face and body.</p><h2 class=block-info-box__heading>Everything you need to know about Sam Hutchinson's tragic death</h2><p><strong>Who was Sam Hutchinson?</strong></p><p>The 34-year-old was tragically <a href=#>killed by a drunk driver as she was leaving her wedding reception</a> with her husband, Aric, who suffered severe injuries.</p><p>Hutchinson was reportedly <a href=#>killed by Jamie Lee Komoroski,</a> who was <a href=#>three-times over the legal limit, </a>while the bride and groom exited the wedding reception on a golf cart.</p><p>Hutchinson was declared dead at the scene.</p><p>Aric <a href=#>filed a wrongful death suit</a> against the alleged drunk driver and the bars that he says over served her before the horrific incident.</p><p><strong>What will happen to Jamie Lee Komoroski?</strong></p><p>Komoroski, 25, plowed into the Hutchinsons’ golf cart while driving around 65 miles per hour, according to Folly Beach police.</p><p>The driver reportedly smelled of alcohol but refused to take a sobriety test.</p><p>She was charged with three felony DUIs resulting in great bodily injury or death and one count of reckless homicide. She is facing up to 25 years in jail.</p><p>Despite <a href=#>alleged special treatment in jail,</a> Komoroski reportedly has griped about everything, from the food to not being allowed to hold the TV remote control — and not getting an exercise mat to do crunches.</p><p>Komoroski has started <a href=#>outlining her plans for her own wedding </a>in a tearful jail phone call with her father, obtained exclusively by The Post.</p><p>Another victim, the groom’s relative Ben Garrett, was also seriously hurt.</p><p>Hutchinson said he does not remember the moment of impact — although he wishes he did.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">Samantha was pronounced dead at the scene at Folley Beach, South Carolina, after the golf cart she was in was rear-ended by a speeding car. <span class=credit>Folly Beach Police Department</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Aric survived but suffered multiple serious injuries, including a brain injury and broken bones. <span class=credit>GoFundMe/Folly Beach Police/MEGA</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Hutchinson, 36, broke down in tears while speaking about losing his wife to a suspected drunk driver. <span class=credit>ABC</span></figure><p>“The last thing I remember [Samantha] saying was she wanted the night to never end,” he recounted through sobs.</p><p>The driver of the Toyota, 25-year-old Jamie Komoroski, has been charged with three counts of felony DUI resulting in death or injury and one count of reckless homicide.</p><p>Hutchinson, who has been recovering at home for more than a week, spoke movingly of his joyful memories from the night of the wedding — before the crash changed everything.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Hutchinson said his mother was the one who told him that Samantha died in the accident. <span class=credit>Facebook / Michael D Peifer</span></figure><p>“I’m still trying to wrap my head around it — that night going from an all-time high to an all-time low,” he said. “It’s pretty rough to comprehend.”</p><p>Hutchinson recalled the feeling of being surrounded by family and friends who had traveled from all over the country to celebrate his and Samantha’s nuptials.</p><p>“She was so happy,” he said of his late bride.</p><p>When asked if he had a message for the driver, Hutchinson said, “She stole something.
