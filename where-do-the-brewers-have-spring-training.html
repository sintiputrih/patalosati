The stadium features practice facilities for both the major and minor league teams of the Brewers. The stadium is easily accessible from the local airport. Due to the Brewers' relatively small fan base, there are usually good tickets available for their games.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Poba Party Patio is a second-story group space located in the right field corner of the ballpark. It can accommodate 50-100 people and offers great views of the field. The space has its own bar and food counters for catering. There are no assigned seats, but groups can sit on the lawn if they prefer. The Courtyard is another designated space along the concourse that can be sectioned off for groups. It has high top tables, chairs, and umbrellas for shade. The Mortenson Courtyard is located on the concourse along the first baseline and is close to amenities. Suites are also available on the press level, and each can hold 15 people. They are air-conditioned and come with a TV, comfortable couches, and a bar railing. Parking lot pregame tailgates are also an option, with activities available in the grassy area of the parking lot. Tent rentals are available for shade. All group spaces are subject to dynamic pricing.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Brewers' spring training games are a great way to experience the excitement of baseball in a more laid-back atmosphere.

The Brewers' training games offer a unique experience for fans to see the team prepare for the regular season. Fans can watch the team practice and interact with players, coaches, and staff members.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Brewers are known for their strong farm system, which produces top-tier prospects every year.
