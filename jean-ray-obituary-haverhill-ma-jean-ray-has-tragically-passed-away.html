Jean Ray, who was 80 years old and from Abingdon, passed away in the Knox County Nursing Home at 5:52 p.m. on Wednesday, October 4, 2023. She would have been a resident of Abingdon. Her home was in Abingdon, where she lived. She was born on November 1st, 1942 in the town of Abingdon, Connecticut, in the United States of America. According to her parents, Ross R. Fielder and Gertrude (Tuttle) Fielder, she was their daughter. Her parents were named Fielder. On February 16, 1968, she tied the knot with Robert E. Ray in the town of Avon, and the civil ceremony was held in that location.</p><p>His death occurred on June 6, 1995, which was prior to her passing away. His passing occurred before hers. She is survived by her sister, Joan B. Tabb, who resides in Galesburg, as well as a number of nieces and nephews, as well as her loyal friends, Christine and Danny Brunswig, who reside in Altona, and their family. In addition, she is survived by her sister. Moreover, she is survived by her family members. All of her family members, including her husband, her parents, and her two brothers, Philip R. and Robert L. Fielder, had already passed away before she did.</p><p>To this day, she was the only member of her family to have survived. Furthermore, the first person to pass away was her spouse. She was the first person to pass away. During the first thirteen years of her professional life, Jean was employed at the Abingdon Brass Factory, where she worked all the way through. For the entirety of her professional life, she worked at that particular place of employment. In the years that followed, she was successful in securing a position at ADM, where she worked as a grain inspector for a considerable amount of time before finally reaching the point where she could retire in the year 2005.</p><p>In the past, she had completed her high school education at Abingdon High School, where she was awarded her diploma. Both Jean and Bob were known for their exceptional bowling skills, and Jean had even held the position of officer within the league during the period that they were members of the league. In addition, Jean enjoyed going horseback riding and helping out on the farm that belonged to her cousin, particularly during the harvest season.</p><p>She was a fan of both of these activities. Jean found that each and every one of these activities was pleasurable. At the graveside in the Avon Cemetery (Avon Cemetery), a memorial service will be held at two o’clock in the afternoon on Thursday, October 12, 2023. The date and time of the service are still to be determined.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwtsSapWaqka56sK7IrayaqqlitaLCxKufoqScYrqiecmemKdlopbGbrTArGStqpGctqSty6WwZqiRqMCmsIyarpqxXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./manola-diez-net-worth-275466.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Manola Diez Net Worth 2024">&larr;
