"Because he is selfish and is not fully committed as a partner," the source claims of Affleck. "J.Lo was so mad, she cut off all ties."</p><p>There has been some speculation about the status of Jennifer Lopez and Leah Remini's friendship, and in 2023, Michelle Visage hinted they had a falling out. In an interview on Las Culturistas podcast with Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang, Visage was asked by host Yang if "[Leah] and J. Lo are best buds, right?" to which she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly made a face</a> and did not give an answer, per Page Six.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Neither Lopez nor Affleck have made a statement about their marriage, and they have been spotted together despite the claims that they are struggling to make their relationship work. But this may be good news for Lopez's friendship because the Page Six source claimed Remini wants to reconnect with Lopez amid her divorce drama. Remini has reportedly "offered her friend support." The source added, "They were friends for years, she wants to reach out to her, but she can't just call up and say, 'I told you so,'" the source reveals.</p><h2 id=what-have-jennifer-lopez-and-leah-remini-said-about-their-friendship>What Have Jennifer Lopez And Leah Remini Said About Their Friendship?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer Lopez and Leah Remini have discussed their friendship before and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recalled how they first met</a> in an interview with ET.

And he was telling Jennifer, 'You have to meet Leah and Angelo [Pagan],' my husband," Remini recalled. "So, we went to the premiere hoping she was gonna be ugly in real life. And then, when I was approaching her, I was like, 'I hope it's the lighting. Maybe she just looks good in here,' and as I got closer, I was like, 'Oh damn, there's a lot of light right here, and she looks really pretty."</p><p>"Her sense of humor, the fact that I could bust her balls and she wasn't caught up on herself, said something to me," Remini explained of the reason they connected.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/your-paragraph-text-2024-01-26t124348-988.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Fans Applauded Leah Remini For Her Honesty When Asked If Tom Cruise Blacklisted Her From Roles In Hollywood">Fans Applauded Leah Remini For Her Honesty When Asked If Tom Cruise Blacklisted Her From Roles In Hollywood</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Leah Remini was very direct when talking about her feud with Tom Cruise and Scientology, and if it hurt her career.</p><p>Lopez also spoke about their connection and how special it was.
