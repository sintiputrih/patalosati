But it wasn’t until recently that they’d ever found a mummified llama sacrifice — let alone four of them.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the Guardian</a>, a team of researchers led by archaeologist Lidio Valdez from the University of Calgary unearthed the mummified remains of four llamas during the excavation of Tambo Viejo, once an important administrative hub for the Incas.</p><p>The fur on the llama remains had matted together but still appeared relatively fluffy, highlighting how well-preserved the naturally mummified animals were. Their bodies were decorated in colorful strings and bracelets and are estimated to have been interred between 1432 and 1459.</p><p>The study noted that researchers could not identify any cuts or wounds on the llama bodies, suggesting that the animals may have been buried alive.</p><p>“Historical records indicate animal sacrifices were important to the Inca, who used them as special offerings to supernatural deities,” said Valdez, who uncovered the llama sacrifices with a team of archaeologists from San Cristóbal of Huamanga University. “This was especially the case of llamas, regarded second only to humans in sacrificial value.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-302098 alt="Mummified Inca Llama Sacrifice" width=900 height=548 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mummified-inca-llama-sacrifice.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-302098 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>L.M. Valdez</span><span class=caption-body>The llamas were likely sacrificed 500 years ago during a celebratory feast.</span></p><p>In addition to the four sacrificial llamas that were found, another decayed llama corpse was discovered seperately, indicating there may have been an attempt to loot the burial, which was decorated with feathers from tropical birds. Archaeologists also found the carcasses of decorated guinea pigs at the site.</p><p>Further excavations of Tambo Viejo found traces of what seemed to be a massive feast. Researchers uncovered large ovens and other findings which pointed to some sort of celebration.</p><p>The new study — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">published</a> in the journal Antiquity in late October 2020 — suggests that the estimated date of the llama sacrifice about five centuries ago happened during the period after the territory was peacefully annexed by the Incas.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-302099 alt=String width=748 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/string.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-302099 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>L.M.

Since then, in addition to the llama burial discovery, researchers have found the remains of a large plaza and a distinct religious Inca structure called ushnu. They also unearthed a connecting road to the Nazca Valley, where the famous <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nazca Lines</a> geoglyphs are located.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-302100 alt="Part Of Mummified Llama" width=900 height=532 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/part-of-mummified-llama.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-302100 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>L.M. Valdez</span><span class=caption-body>Body part of one of the mummified llamas which appears to have been a brown llama.</span></p><p>Past studies have determined that llamas were significant to Inca culture. While the four-legged animals were hunted for their meat as food, they were also most frequently used as sacrificial offerings, more so than human sacrifices.</p><p>The Inca rituals were performed at specific times of the year. A hundred llamas were sacrificed in October to promote a healthy rainy season, and in February another 100 llamas were sacrificed to bring the rainstorms to a stop.</p><p>Bernabé Cobo, a colonial-period Spanish chronicler, wrote that the animals were used for different sacrifices based on their coloring. Brown-furred llamas were sacrificed to the creator god, Viracocha, while white llamas were presented as offerings to the sun. Llamas with mixed-colored coats were sacrificed to the thunder.</p><p>It’s clear that each offering made by the Incas had its own significance and purpose.</p><p>As the researchers wrote in their study, “Through these ceremonies, the Inca created new orders, new understandings and meanings that helped to legitimise and justify their actions to both the conquerors and the conquered.”</p><p>Next, learn why the <a href=#>Incas may have deliberately built the famous Machu Picchu site along fault lines</a> and read about the return of <a href=#>the 500-Year-Old Incan ‘princess’ mummy that was finally repatriated to Bolivia.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyuwcymoJ%2BhlZl6rbjAppisZZmjsKJ50pqaq6GWnrCm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-did-jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-break-up.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Now That Bennifer Is Back, Fans Want to Know Why They Ever Broke up in the First Place">&larr;
