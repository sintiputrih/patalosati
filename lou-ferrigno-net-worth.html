They were made by actor <a href=#>Ted Cassidy</a> (Lurch in <a href=#>The Addams Family</a> (1964)) until 1979 (first two seasons). Then, after Cassidy's death in that year, the Hulk was voiced by actor <a href=#>Charles Napier</a> for the remaining three seasons and the three movies made in later years.</td></tr><tr readability=1.5128205128205><td>7</td><td>Best known by the public for his starring role as <a href=#>The Incredible Hulk</a> (1978).</td></tr><tr readability=8.8193430656934><td>8</td><td>In October 1981 he was in Egypt, scheduled to be one of Egyptian President <a href=#>Anwar Sadat</a>'s personal guests at a public event. However, at the last minute Sadat canceled his appearance. A few days later Muslim fundamentalists killed Sadat, along with 12 others, at an annual military parade. It was later discovered that Sadat's killers had originally planned to assassinate him at the event where Ferrigno would have been seated next to him. Ferrigno believes that he would have been killed along with Sadat if Sadat had not canceled his appearance.</td></tr><tr readability=4.6184738955823><td>9</td><td>In his book "My Incredible Life As The Hulk", he stated that he has never been compensated for any merchandising related to <a href=#>The Incredible Hulk</a> (1978) TV series. He said it was because no such deals existed for him during the show's prime-time run.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>10</td><td>He stands 6' 3" and he was the tallest professional body builder of the 1970s.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>11</td><td>2/11/06: He was sworn in as a Los Angeles County Reserve Deputy Sheriff.

In the 1990s he played the role again in an animated series for the UPN network, <a href=#>The Incredible Hulk</a> (1996) -- this time providing the creature's voice. In <a href=#>Ang Lee</a>'s 2003 film <a href=#>Hulk</a> (2003) the Hulk is computer-generated, so Lou plays a completely different part - that of a security guard (along with <a href=#>Stan Lee</a>) at the lab where Bruce Banner works. In the 2008 film <a href=#>The Incredible Hulk</a> (2008), he plays a security guard again, this time one who allows Bruce Banner to enter with a pizza -- and also, once again, voices the Hulk.</td></tr><tr readability=4.8059701492537><td>15</td><td>Beat out <a href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> for the role of the Hulk on the TV series <a href=#>The Incredible Hulk</a> (1978).
