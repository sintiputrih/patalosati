Bradberry also collaborated with a clothing company that was unfamiliar to NFL spectators and players in 2023. The Samford graduate began his NFL career with the Carolina Panthers in 2016.</p><p>He was picked in the second round by the Panthers and stayed with the organization until 2019. Bradberry had his greatest season in the NFL last year, appearing in Super Bowl LVII against Patrick Mahomes’ Kansas City Chiefs.&nbsp;Bradberry and 49ers receiver Deebo Samuel had a few words a few weeks ago. Samuel called James “trash” and subsequently stated he didn’t regret it. But the cornerback defused the situation by saying that although he doesn’t necessarily agree with what Samuel said, he won’t engage in a verbal brawl with him.</p><h2>James Bradberry Net Worth: Sponsorship Deals of an NFL Star</h2><p><strong>James Bradberry</strong>, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles, is said to have a $8 million net worth. The Alabama native amassed his seven-figure income mostly from his NFL career and endorsement agreements.&nbsp;Bradberry began his NFL career with the Carolina Panthers in 2016, and three seasons later, he joined the Giants. He was with the Giants for two seasons before joining the Eagles in 2022.&nbsp;Bradberry became the first NFL player for the apparel company Hoka earlier this year, in May. Hoka began their foray into mainstream professional sport by appointing Bradberry as their spokesperson.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/James-Bradberry-1.jpg alt="James Bradberry" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Hoka said in their statement that they intended to engage with youthful and sporty customers via Bradberry. They further claimed that the NFL player became a fan of the brand after suffering an injury early in his career.&nbsp;He teamed with Matt Blatt’s Car Dealerships, a Philadelphia-based firm, last year. Bradberry, like many of his athletic buddies, enjoys playing golf in his spare time. He generally posts multiple photos of himself on the golf course.</p><p>Bradberry has previously used his daughter, Xena, in Hoka marketing campaigns. The father-daughter team is also active with the organization. In July, James and his daughter paid a visit to the Simpson House elderly care home.&nbsp;Hundreds of pairs of Hoka shoes were given to locals by him and Xena. The football player also spent time talking with the group and playing different activities with them. As a result, the NFL athlete has made it a point to give back to the community.</p><h2>James Bradberry Contract and Salary Information</h2><p>After having the finest season of his career, James Bradberry extended his contract with the Eagles on March 15, 2023. Despite saying he had more lucrative offers, the former Giants player signed the $38 million contract.&nbsp;The Eagles signed the cornerback to a one-year contract for $7.2 million. In 2023, his new deal includes a completely guaranteed basic pay of $1,165,000. In 2024, the basic pay is completely guaranteed at $1,210,000, with a guaranteed option bonus of $9,640,000.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/James-Bradberry-2.jpg alt="James Bradberry" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Bradberry has come a long way since his first NFL deal, which was underwhelming to say the least. Bradberry signed a four-year, $3.9 million deal with the Carolina Panthers in his first season, including a $1,080,608 signing bonus.&nbsp;Bradberry signed a three-year, $43,500,000 deal with the Giants in 2020.
