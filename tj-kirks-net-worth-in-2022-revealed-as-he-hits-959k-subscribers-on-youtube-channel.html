He is famous for creating videos in an aggressive and controversial style.</p><p>The primary reason for his channel’s success is Kirk’s criticism of religion. He was one of the hosts of a YouTube news podcast focused on current events and interviews, Drunken Peasants, from 2014 to 2014.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Name</strong></td><td>Tj Kirk</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Real Name</strong></td><td>Thomas James Kirk III</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birthdate</strong></td><td>February 20, 1985</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>37 years</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>YouTuber and Podcast host</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$2 million</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tj-kirks-net-worth-in-2022></span>Tj Kirk’s Net Worth In 2022<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Famous YouTuber Tj Kirk has a net worth of&nbsp;<strong>$2 million.</strong></p><p>He earned his wealth through his worldwide famous YouTube channel, Amazing Atheist. His channel has over 959K subscribers. His total views count on his channel is over 426 million. Thus, he must have earned a decent amount of money from there.</p><p>He started his YouTube journey on November 2006 when he first started posting his videos. A year later, he posted a warning video about the 18-year-old Pekka-Eric Auvinen and his mental instability, who would later perpetrate the Jokela school shooting.</p><p>He appeared twice on The Joe Rogan Experience, in January 2016 and March 2017, respectively. In 2016, Kirk spoke with Milo Yiannopoulos for a Drunken Peasants podcast. Based on comments made during the show, the interview caused Breitbart, CPAC, and Simon & Schuster to cut relations with Yiannopoulos.</p><p>YouTubers earn millions. This fact can be proved by the comparison of some of the famous YouTuber’s net worth.</p><table border=1><tbody><tr><td><strong>YouTubers</strong></td><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Tj Kirk</td><td>$2 million</td></tr><tr><td>MrBeast</td><td>$54 million</td></tr><tr><td>Jale Paul</td><td>$45 million</td></tr><tr><td>Markiplier</td><td>$38 million</td></tr><tr><td>Rhett and Link</td><td>$30 million</td></tr><tr><td>Unspeakable</td><td>$28.5 million</td></tr><tr><td>Nastva</td><td>$28 million</td></tr><tr><td>Ryan Kaji</td><td>$27 million</td></tr><tr><td>Dude Perfect</td><td>$20 million</td></tr><tr><td>Logan Paul</td><td>$18 million</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The above information has been validated by&nbsp;Forbes, thus, it proves that Tj Kirk must be earning millions and his wealth is expected to increase even more in the coming years.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tj-kirks-professional-career></span>Tj Kirk’s Professional Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tj Kirk’s&nbsp;YouTube&nbsp;career is filled with controversies and negativities.</p><p>His comments regarding different things are often very toxic and get him into many troubles. He made controversial headlines when his comment on a sensitive topic got him in trouble in 2012.</p><p>With Christian philosopher William Lane Craig, Kirk spoke on a CNN panel as a guest in 2013 about the emergence of atheism in America.</p><p>After some time, he realized that his comments were too sensitive, which led him to delete some words. Besides being a YouTuber, he is also a host of the Drunken Peasants Podcast show, where he delivers the news on current affairs and conducts many interviews.</p><p>In late 2017, he stepped down from the show and commenced his podcast, Deep Fat Fried. He runs the show with his brother Scotty Kirk and Paul Parkey Jr., which has been very successful in recent days.</p><p>In 2018, Kirk came under fire for a controversial tweet about Alicia Vikander and how something about her is insufficient to play the video game character Lara Croft in the 2018 movie Tomb Raider. He was also criticized for later posting a video to his YouTube channel about Lara Croft.</p><p>A TJ-starring video posted online in late 2011 was dubbed “very intimate” and “disgusting.” In the video, TJ appeared with a banana, chocolate syrup, and coffee. In BANANAGATE 2011, The Amazing Atheist gave the video an apathetic response. A second “very personal” film, including hot oil, was also posted online.</p><p>When the perpetrator of the Trollhättan school attack was discovered to be a follower of Kirk and other such YouTubers in 2015, he was also highlighted in press reports at that time.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-tj-kirks-wife></span>Who Is Tj Kirk’s Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thomas James “TJ” Kirk III is married to his wife,<strong>&nbsp;Chelsea Theimp.</strong></p><p>She is active on her Instagram account with the username&nbsp;@chelsea_theimp.</p><p>On August 11, 2018, Tj announced that he was getting married to her through his Instagram post. The pair has been married for more than four years and looks happy.</p><p>She is frequently seen on his Instagram posts, where the two enjoy each other’s company. According to his Instagram post, his wife was born on December 7, but her exact birth year has not been disclosed yet. According to her photos online, she seems to be in her early 30s.</p><p>There is no rumor or single hint about their child in both Instagram posts. They might be trying to spend some alone time together before thinking about being parents.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tj-kirks-early-life></span>Tj Kirk’s Early Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tj Kirk was born in Pasadena, California, but was raised mostly in Mandeville, Louisiana.</p><p>Thomas James Kirt Jr., his father, ran many fraudulent higher education institutions and, as a result of a plea agreement, was sentenced to three years in a US federal prison. Kirk dropped out of high school at sixteen because he wanted to become a novelist.</p><p>The details of his upbringing are not widely known. Therefore, the YouTuber has kept most of it a secret.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=some-faqs></span>Some FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-tj-kirks-real-name></span>What Is Tj Kirk’s Real Name?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>YouTuber and Podcast host Tj Kirk’s real name is Thomas James Kirk III.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-tj-kirk></span>How Old Is Tj Kirk?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tj Kirk is 37 years old and was born on February 20, 1985.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-was-tj-kirk-born></span>Where Was Tj Kirk Born?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tj Kirk was born in Pasadena, California.
