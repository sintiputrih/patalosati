The drink has a rich history within Mexico, with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Liquor.com</a> noting its origin dates back to 1000 B.C. &nbsp;The modern version is distilled from the blue agave plant in the Mexican state of Jalisco, where the town of Tequila, Mexico, resides. As a literal trademark of Mexican culture – “tequila” cannot be produced outside of Mexico, the way “champagne” can’t be made outside of France – tequila and mezcal continue to taste delicious and gain a greater foothold in mainstream American drinking culture. Part of that success is due to some of your favorite celebs jumping aboard the tequila train.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>From <strong>Sammy Hagar </strong>launching Cabo Wabo, which some consider the “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>OG Celebrity Tequila</a>,” to <strong>Kevin Hart </strong>launching Gran Coramino in May 2022, many stars from music, sports, movies, and reality television have partnered with distilleries in Mexico to launch their own brands. So, be it Cinco de Mayo, National Paloma Day (May 22), National Margarita Day (February 22), National Tequila Day (July 24), National Mezcal Day (October 21), or the actual day of Mexican Independence (September 16), here are some celebrity tequila brands that you can enjoy.</p><h2>George Clooney, Casamigos</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/George-Clooney-Casamigos-tequila-brand-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>One of the more well-known celebrity tequila brands in recent times is Casamigos. Launched in 2013 by <strong>George Clooney</strong>, businessman <strong>Rande Gerber</strong>, and property developer <strong>Mike Meldman</strong>, it has become one of the mainstays of the tequila shelf at your liquor store.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Casamigos was always intended as our house Tequila for our homes in Mexico, and only recently, at the urging of people who enjoyed it with us, we decided to make it available to the public,” George told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Wine Enthusiast</a> in 2013. It quickly proved to be a lucrative venture. In 2017, spirits company Diago bought Casamigos for $1 billion, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Guardian</a>. George would continue to promote the brand since he will forever be synonymous with it (despite no longer owning it.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“If you asked us four years ago if we had a $1bn company, I don’t think we would have said yes,” Clooney said in a statement. “This reflects Diageo’s belief in our company and our belief in Diageo. But we’re not going anywhere. We’ll still be very much a part of Casamigos. Starting with a shot tonight. Maybe two.”</p><h2>Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson, Teremana</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Rock-Teremana-tequila-brand-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Launched in March 2020, Teremana is a “tequila of the people,” according to the founder, <strong>Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson</strong>. “After years of hard work, this is truly a dream come true. My team and I are committed to bringing you the highest in quality tequila because quality, the people, the land, and legacy are what matter most,” writes The Rock on Teremana’s website.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>In 2022, Dwayne Johnson and Tereman brought back Guac on The Rock. When consumers purchase a Teremana cocktail with an order of guac, they will be reimbursed up to $10—whether you dine in or take out. To qualify, all a person needs to do is upload an itemized receipt at guacontherock.com or by scanning the unique QR code in the restaurant. The campaign runs until May 8, 2022.

Cuarenta</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/earl8-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>“I’m going to pull up some E Cuarenta Tequila Anejo made by Earl Stevens, you understand me?” E-40 told <strong>HollywoodLife </strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>when discussing his spirits portfolio</a> in 2021. “Just so y’all know. ‘E Cuarenta’ means ‘E-40’ in Spanish. Hello!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“So you know what I’m saying?” says the man, whose tequila is almost as smooth and charismatic as he is. “I’m all about the juice, man! Because you know the proof is in the pudding, man. The proof is in the pudding. If your juice is nasty, that word is going to get around, you know what I’m saying? I’ve got to make sure mine is A-plus, man. You understand me?”</p><h2>Kevin Hart, Gran Coramino</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Kevin-Hart-Gran-Coramino-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>“As someone who loves tequila, I’ve spent the past two years working with Juan Domingo to create a brand and product of the highest possible quality that is accessible to my fans. Juan is an undisputed leader in the tequila industry and, like me, strives for excellence in everything he does,” said <strong>Kevin Hart </strong>in a statement announcing the launch of Gran Coramino tequila.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“I wanted something different in the market, to tell a story that hadn’t been told before for my fans, for my culture, and a generation who has never tasted a Cristalino before. It’s the best-kept secret in tequila.”</p><h2>Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs, DeLeon</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Celeb-Tequila-Brands-embed-1.jpg alt width=620 height=868 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>After launching his vodka brand, <strong>Sean “Diddy” Combs </strong>decided to enter the tequila business in 2014. The business mogul purchased DeLeon in partnership with British drinks multinational Diageo. “With Ciroc, we tested the waters—or, I would say, we dated,” Diddy told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Forbes</a>. “Now, with this joint venture, we took this step, and we got married. I think it’s organic, I think we work together so well, we have a proven track record, and I wouldn’t want to do it with anybody else.”</p><h2>Eva Longoria, Casa Del Sol</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Celeb-Tequila-Brands-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15>Co-founded by Mexican-American actress, producer, director, and activist <strong>Eva Longoria,</strong> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Casa Del Sol</a> helps disrupts the boys’ club of tequila.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>The talent behind this brand is female. <strong>Alejandra Pelayo </strong>is Casa Del Sol’s head of production. She is also a protégé and goddaughter of the late Francisco Alcaraz, tequila pioneer and master distiller/creator of Patrón. <strong>Mariana Padilla</strong> is a Mexican-based artisan, entrepreneur, and daughter of Paco Padilla, the cultural ambassador of Jalisco, Mexico.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>What sets Casa Del Sol apart is that while most tequilas age in whiskey barrels, Casa Del Sol partnered with Laurent Martell, the 9th generation of the Martell family in France, and sourced Cognac barrels handcrafted with French Limousin Oak.</p><h2>Michael Jordan, Cincoro</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/eva-longoria-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-18>Cincoro (a combination of “Cinco” and “oro” or “five gold”) represents the five basketball power brokers behind the brand: <strong>Jeanie Buss</strong> of the Los Angeles Lakers, <strong>Wes Edens</strong> of the Milwaukee Bucks<strong>, Emilia Fazzalari</strong> and her husband <strong>Wyc Grousbeck</strong> of the Boston Celtics, and <strong>Michael Jordan</strong>, who owns the Charlotte Hornets. The five bonded over a mutual love of tequila during a 2016 dinner, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Men’s Journal</a>. That love resulted in Cincoro, a tequila that itself looks like a trophy.</p><h2>LeBron James, Lobos 1707</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Lebron-james-Lobos-1707-Tequila-embed.jpg alt width=620 height=826 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p id=content-paragraph-20>Like Air Jordan, <strong>LeBron James </strong>knew he had to get into the tequila business. He invested in Lobos 1707, a brand founded by Diego Osorio, chief creative officer, and CEO Dia Simms, who has worked with brands such as Deleón Tequila and Cîroc Vodka, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Spirits Business</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>“I knew the first time I tasted Lobos 1707 Tequila that it was special,” said Lebron. “When I learned more about the brand story and leadership team, I knew I wanted to be a part of it. Lobos 1707 is about celebrating the strength of the group and bringing people together. It’s about shared passion and values. I love sipping Tequila with my friends, and we want a brand that speaks to us.”</p><h2>Mark Wahlberg, Flecha Azul</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Michael-Jordan-Cincoro-Tequila-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-22>Tequila? From Boston’s own <strong>Mark Wahlberg</strong>? “It’s funny because when it was first mentioned to me, I said ‘absolutely not,'” Wahlberg told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CNN Business</a> in January 2022. “You have all these other people out there claiming to have gone to Mexico and created tequila and cultivated agave and all this stuff. They were like, ‘This is not what that is, we have two amazing guys who are really young and like-minded.’ … I just said I would love to invest in them.” Mark teamed with Mexican PGA golfer <strong>Abraham Ancer</strong> and entrepreneur <strong>Aron Marquez</strong> to launch Flecha Azul, with Mark as the principal investor.</p><h2>Aaron Paul & Bryan Cranston, Dos Hombres</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Lebron-james-Lobos-1707-Tequila-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-23>Forget Blue Sky. Dos Hombres – by Breaking Bad costars <strong>Bryan Cranston </strong>and <strong>Aaron Paul </strong>– is a mezcal brand launched in 2019. In June 2021, Constellation Brands, Inc acquired a minority stake in the artisanal and hand-crafted mezcal brand.</p><p id=content-paragraph-24>Dos Hombres is not a tequila. It’s a mezcal, which is also made from agave, like tequila. However, tequila is only made from agave tequilana Weber, or Weber blue agave, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Wine Enthusiast</a>. Mezcal is made from up to 50 species of the agave plant. Plus, tequila agave is steamed in ovens, whereas mezcal agave is roasted in underground pits.</p><p id=content-paragraph-25>All tequilas are mezcals, but not all mezcals are tequilas.</p><p id=content-paragraph-26>(If you aren’t feeling like some Walt and Jessie mezcal, why not get some <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dirty Devil Vodka</strong></a>, who partnered with <strong>Giancarlo Esposito </strong>to name him as their Global Brand Ambassador. The vibrant, premium vodka is the first and only spirit in the world made with Hyper-Oxygenated water – and that’s science! Walt would approve.)</p><h2>The Chainsmokers, JAJA Tequila</h2><p id=content-paragraph-27><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Stars-With-Tequila-Brands-embed.jpg alt width=620 height=414 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p id=content-paragraph-28>JAJA Tequila was launched in 2018 by brothers <strong>Maurice</strong> and <strong>Elliot Tebele</strong> and their childhood friend <strong>Martin Hoffstein. </strong>The trio had a mission of creating a fun, vibrant, and approachable lifestyle tequila. Soon after, GRAMMY-winning duo <strong>Alex Pall</strong> and<strong> Drew Taggart</strong> of The Chainsmokers, who built their brand on the same principles as JAJA, became co-owners of the company. Together, this group has marketed JAJA to their generation, making it one of the most in-demand tequila brands for their age groups.</p><h2>Justin TImberlake, Sauza 901</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Mark-Wahlberg-and-Flecha-Azul-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-29>“My love for tequila began a few years ago after I visited the tequila heartland of Jalisco, Mexico, and saw the passion and craftsmanship that goes into every bottle,” &nbsp;<strong>Justin Timberlake </strong>said in a 2014 statement, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Beverage Industry</a>. “That trip inspired me to create [Sauza 901], and I’m thrilled to partner with Sauza to spread the word about this great tequila.”</p><h2>Nick Jonas, Villa One</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Aaron-Paul-and-Bryan-Cranston-Dos-Hombres-Tequila-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-30>“I think tequila is naturally something that brings people together,” <strong>Nick Jonas </strong>told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sharp magazine</a> when discussing his tequila, Villa one. “It really is a celebratory drink. We drink it like Champagne, and it seems to be a constant when we are celebrating with friends. When you’re making art, or music, or even tequila, when you’re bringing people together, that’s a real win.”</p><h2>Kendall Jenner, 818</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Stars-With-Tequila-Brands-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-31><strong>Kendall Jenner </strong>launched 818 Tequila in May 2021. Named after the area code for Calabasas, 818, Kendall told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Elle.com</a> that she’s been a “huge tequila lover for several years now” and that “after trying different types, I wanted to make one meant for enjoying with family and friends.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-32>“I’m excited to step into the spirit industry, which has historically been male-dominated,” said Kendall. “Hopefully, I can inspire other women to become founders or work in the same field, which definitely needs more female representation.”</p><h2>Adam Levine and Behati Prinsloo, Calirosa</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Justin-Timberlake-Sauza-901-tequila-brand-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-33><strong>Adam Levine </strong>and his wife, <strong>Behati Prinsloo</strong>, got into the tequila business in July 2021. The two are partners in Calirosa, tequila that is distilled traditionally before being matured in red wine barrels from California. The debut expressions were Rosa Blanco and the Añejo which are &nbsp;“100% premium Rosa Tequila.” The line has expanded to include a <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rosa Blanco</a>, </strong>a<strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Reposado</a>, </strong>an <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Añejo</a>, </strong>and an <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Extra Añejo</a>. </strong>For simple and delicious cocktail recipes to whip up at home, click&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>HERE</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-34>The tequilas are produced by the Real family, who have been crafting agave spirits in Amatitán, Jalisco, since 1942.

Ora is a shareholder and chief creative partner of the tequila produced at the Don Roberto Distillery in Jalisco, Mexico, by Stella Anguiano. “This has been one of my favorite projects to work on because it has given me the opportunity to work with Stella, one of the few female distillers in the industry,” said Rita, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Spirits Business</a>.</p><h2>Guy Fieri & Sammy Hagar, Santo Fino</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nick-Jonas-Villa-One-Tequila-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-38>Sammy Hagar sold the last of his stake in Cabo Wabo tequila in 2010. Almost a decade later, he teamed with <strong>Guy Fieri </strong>to launch Santo Tequila in 2017. “I have been in this business for over 30 years, and if anyone knows good tequila, it’s me. I live and breathe tequila,” Sammy said in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a 2021 press release</a> about the expansion of the Santo Spirits family to include Santo Reposado.</p><h2>George Strait, Código 1530</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/kendall-jenner-818-Tequila-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-39>“I was never a big tequila drinker before Código,” country music legend <strong>George Straight</strong> told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a> in 2021. “If I drank it at all, it was with a lime, and I would try to get the taste out of my mouth as fast as I could. I think that was from all the additives that some companies put in their tequila, which we don’t do. There is no harsh burning aftertaste to it, so it’s very nice to sip on straight.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-40>George launched the Codigo 1530 brand in 2016 and has spread the word about the brand since then. “The other founders and I had been drinking the unnamed juice for a few years before we decided to try and take it to the rest of the world,” he added. “None of us were trying or had any plans to start a tequila company, but it was just too good not to share.”</p><h2>Thomas Rhett, Dos Primos</h2><p id=content-paragraph-41><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Thomas-Rhett-Dos-Primos-Tequila-embed-1.jpg alt width=620 height=827 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p id=content-paragraph-42>“When Jeff and I started the Dos Primos Tequila company four years ago, we knew we wanted to continue to expand our tequila family,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>said&nbsp;</a><strong>Thomas Rhet</strong>t in 2022, when rolling out the new Dos Primos Tequila Reposado. “We’ve been so blown away by the response to our blanco and couldn’t be more pumped to now introduce a reposado together. Similar to our original goal, we’ve worked hard to make this as versatile as possible and seamlessly fit into any activity, regardless of the time of year.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-43>Dos Primos is distilled at Destiladora González Lux, located just outside the city of Arandas, Mexico, in the highlands of Jalisco, per a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>press release.</a> Rodolfo González, a third-generation master distiller at Destiladora González Lux, worked with Thomas Rhett and Tomas’s cousin, <strong>Jeff</strong> <strong>Worn,</strong> to create the taste profiles of the blanco and reposado offerings.</p><h2>Jimmy Buffett, Margaritaville</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Adam-Levine-and-Behati-Prinsloo-Calirosa-Tequila-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-44>It makes sense that <strong>Jimmy Buffett</strong>, the man who wrote and recorded “Margaritaville,” would have a tequila brand with that name, right? Much like the Margaritaville restaurants, the Margaritaville line of tequilas is “inspired by the lifestyle of Jimmy Buffett. These tequilas, rums, and cocktails have become synonymous with a tropical escapism state-of-mind, where the everyday pressures of life take a back seat to fun.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-45>Remember to drink responsibly.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-46>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8Keo56aop7BunnTnqiuoZyWeqO%2BwKebrGVkbH93hJdpZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./winnie-holzman-net-worth-60854.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Winnie Holzman Net Worth">&larr;
