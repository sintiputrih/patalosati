He is an unquestionably dedicated husband and loving father who would do everything for his family.</p><p>In 2020, Michael blasted the NBA’s regulation that barred coaches’ families from attending the private institution near Orlando, where the campaign had restarted during the COVID-19 outbreak.</p><p>ESPN said at the time that athletes were allowed to see family members for the first time that week. When the Conference Finals begin, referees can bring one visitor into the bubble.</p><p>While coaches were not permitted to bring family members within the bubble, Malone believed the rule was illegal.</p><p>The head coach also expressed regret for the action, noting that he was missing his family.</p><p>Malone stated that he spoke for himself because it had already been sixty days and he was not being allowed to have his family by his side.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Personal_Life_and_Relationships_of_Michael_Malone></span>Personal Life and Relationships of Michael Malone<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following Michael Malone’s public life, he is currently married to his wife, Jocelyn Malone.
