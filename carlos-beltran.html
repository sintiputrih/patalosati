Carlos received more than $160 million in compensation during his baseball career. His highest single-season compensation was $19.4 million, which he received from the New York Mets in the 2009-10 season.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Carlos Beltrán?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Carlos Beltrán </a>was born April 24, 1977, in Manatí, Puerto Rico. Growing up, he was a talented athlete who excelled in sports like baseball and volleyball. However, at the insistence of his father, he eventually dropped volleyball to focus only on baseball. Beltrán attended Fernando Callejo High School and graduated in 1995.</p><p>Carlos Beltrán previously played for the Kansas City Royals, the New York Mets, the St. Louis Cardinals, the New York Yankees, and the Houston Astros. From 1998 to 2017, he won three Gold Glove and two Silver Slugger Awards and has the highest success rate of any major league in stealing bases. Following his retirement, Beltrán was reported to be the mastermind behind the Astros’ illicit sign-stealing program</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How old is Carlos Beltrán?</h2><p>He is currently 46 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Carlos Beltrán’s net worth?</h2><p>He is estimated to be worth $80 Million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Carlos Beltrán’s career?</h2><p>The Kansas City Royals selected Beltrán in the second round of the 1995 MLB draft. He was then assigned to the Gulf Coast Royals of the rookie-level Gulf Coast League. Beltrán went on to play for the Spokane Indians in the Class A-Short Season Northwest League the following year. He later played for several minor league organizations, including the Lansing Lugnuts, Wilmington Blue Rocks, and Wichita Wranglers.</p><p>Beltrán was called up to the Kansas City Royals and made his major league debut in September 1998. The following season, he was the team’s starting center fielder and leadoff hitter. Beltrán had an excellent debut season, hitting 22 home runs and winning the AL Rookie of the Year award.</p><p>While injuries limited his 2000 season, he rebounded in 2001, hitting 24 home runs and batting 306. Beltrán maintained his good performance in 2002, with 29 home runs and a.273 batting average, and in 2003, with 26 home runs and a.307 batting average. His final season with the Royals in 2004 was less impressive, characterized by trade speculations and general manager Allard Baird’s aim to destroy the struggling team.</p><p>Beltran was dealt to the Houston Astros in June 2004. He hit 258 with 23 home runs in 90 games. Making it to the playoffs, he tied Barry Bonds’ single postseason home run record with eight. The Astros won the National League Division Series before losing to the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Championship Series.</p><p>Beltrán, a free agent after the 2004 season, agreed to a seven-year contract with the New York Mets. In August 2005, he sustained a catastrophic injury after colliding head-on with fellow Mets outfielder Mike Cameron during a game against the San Diego Padres.</p><p>He was also plagued by a quadriceps ailment that limited his play throughout the season, resulting in career lows in several statistical categories. Beltrán performed better in 2006, tying the Mets’ single-season home run record with 41. He also won his first Silver Slugger and Gold Glove Awards. Beltrán and the Mets advanced to the NLCS, where they lost to the Cardinals.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpyYq6SfqHqjscutqZqmXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./angelina-jolie-not-a-fan-of-obama-20092411.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Angelina Jolie Not a Fan of Obama">&larr;
