Though the show was canceled and forced to wrap up its story in a special finale, the show had a dedicated fanbase and viewers thoroughly enjoyed the supernatural show. Shadowhunters followed Clary Fray, played by Katherine McNamara, as she is thrown into a world of angels and monsters. With the help of her friends, Clary fights demons and her own father as he attempts to take over the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the show’s end, the cast has been very busy. They have jumped from project to project, and many have actually come back together to work with each other again. Harry Shum Jr. has been busy making movies, while McNamara is about to be the lead in another show. Here’s everything the cast of Shadowhunters have been doing since the show ended.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Is The Most Followed ‘Shadowhunters’ Star On Instagram In 2021?</a></span></p><h2 id=isaiah-mustafa-broke-his-hand-filming-it-chapter-two><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Isaiah Mustafa Broke His Hand Filming It: Chapter Two</span></h2><p>Isaiah Mustafa waited a long time for an opportunity like It: Chapter Two. Ever since his iconic Old Spice campaign in 2010, Mustafa struggled to be taken seriously in the acting business. Shadowhunters was a welcome change as the actor was able to play the parental figure Luke Garroway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since his time on the Freeform show, Mustafa landed the lead role in the second installment of the It franchise, It: Chapter Two. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mustafa actually broke his hand while filming</a>! “I did that [chair-slamming] so many times, and they kept bringing chairs… I don’t know what I did, but it kicked back on me or something.”</p><h2 id=luke-baines-wrote-untitled-horror-movie><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Luke Baines Wrote Untitled Horror Movie</span></h2><p>In Shadowhunters, Luke Baines played the second version of Jonathan Morgenstern. Since Shadowhunters, Baines has had brief roles in the shows The Mandalorian and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and will be in the upcoming projects Bunker and No Tears In Hell.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most notably, Baines wrote his own movie! During the pandemic, many actors were struggling to find work, and Baines took it upon himself to create a work of art. With the help of Nick Simon, Baines wrote Untitled Horror Movie, a comedic horror film which he then starred in as Declan. Katherine McNamara, his television sister on Shadowhunters, also joined the cast.</p><h2 id=harry-shum-jr-stars-in-all-my-life><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Harry Shum Jr. Stars In All My Life</span></h2><p>Harry Shum Jr. has had quite an interesting career in Hollywood. Fans will remember him as a great dancer in the show Glee. His role in Shadowhunters was a bisexual warlock and a fan favorite. Besides his part in the show Tell Me A Story, Shum has transitioned into taking on more film roles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shum was a part of Crazy Rich Asians in 2018 and the <a href=#>2022 film </a><a href=#>Everything Everywhere All At Once</a>. He had a large role as Owen Lin in Netflix’s 2021 Love Hard, a holiday film starring Nina Dobrev. Shum got to be the leading man in the film All My Life, acting alongside Jessica Rothe in the romance story.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Winchesters Breathes New Life Into The CW’s Supernatural; Here’s What We Know</a></span></p><h2 id=alberto-rosende-fights-fire-in-chicago-fire><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Alberto Rosende Fights Fire In Chicago Fire</span></h2><p>Fans are disappointed Alberto Rosende has not released more music after singing for his character in Shadowhunters. At least fans are still able to see Rosende every week on the television show Chicago Fire. He plays Blake Gallow and was also featured in the show’s crossover event with Chicago P.D.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rosende can thank his time on Shadowhunters for meeting his fiancée. Rosende met Tessa Mossey, who played Heidi McKenzie for 8 episodes, while on set. The two have been together since 2018 and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">got engaged at the end of 2021</a>. Shadowhunters fans are excited to see these two love birds tie the knot.</p><h2 id=what-is-emeraude-toubia-rsquo-s-amazon-prime-show><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>What Is Emeraude Toubia’s Amazon Prime Show?</span></h2><p>Emeraude Toubia has been the leading lady in a bunch of productions since her supporting role on Shadowhunters. Toubia filmed two movies for Hallmark, one in 2019 and the other in 2021. The actress played Alana in Love in the Sun and Belinda Sawyer in Holiday in Sante Fe. She will also star in the upcoming films The Ballad of a Hustler and Like It Used To Be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Toubia has also been busy with her own television show on Amazon Prime. She plays Lily Diaz on With Love. The show focuses on the Diaz family, specifically Lily and her brother Jorge as they work through finding love and purpose.</p><h2 id=matthew-daddario-joins-sister-alexandra-daddario-in-why-women-kill><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Matthew Daddario Joins Sister Alexandra Daddario In Why Women Kill</span></h2><p>The Daddario family is certainly a talented one. Mattew Daddario’s sister Alexandra Daddario is a well-known actress due to her work in the Percy Jackson franchise, Baywatch, and the show The White Lotus. She had an important role in the first season of Why Women Kill, an anthology series following various women as they grapple with their marriages. Matthew Daddario followed his sister’s footsteps and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had a leading in the second season as Scooter Polarsky</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Daddario also got the chance to work with his Shadowhunters costar Katherine McNamara on a film. They had leading roles in the 2021 film Trust, which also starred Victoria Justice and Lucien Laviscount.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Victoria Justice’s Secret Boyfriends</a></span></p><h2 id=what-is-dominic-sherwood-doing-since-shadowhunters-ending><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>What Is Dominic Sherwood Doing Since Shadowhunters Ending?</span></h2><p>Dominic Sherwood has been in Hollywood long before Shadowhunters.

The actor starred in Penny Dreadful: City of Angles, the spinoff show of Penny Dreadful. His film, Eraser: Reborn, also came out this year. He plays the leading role of U.S. Marshal Mason Pollard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Recently, Sherwood has teamed up with co-star Katherine McNamara to create the 'Return To The Shadows' podcast. Together they are re-watching the entire Shadowhunters show. They have brought on many cast members as they discuss behind-the-scene aspects of the series. Fans are loving getting the inside scoop of the beloved show.</p><h2 id=katherine-mcnamara-is-abby-walker-in-walker-independence><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Katherine McNamara Is Abby Walker In Walker: Independence</span></h2><p>Katherine McNamara is a workaholic as she is the busiest of her Shadowhunters cast mates. Directly following the show’s end, McNamara joined the CW’s Arrow. She played Mia Smoak, <a href=#>daughter of Oliver Queen and Felicity Smoak</a>. There was discussion of giving her a spin-off show as Mia Smoak, but the plans were scrapped.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though she certainly loves teaming up with old cast mates as she has in Untitled Horror Movie, Trust, and the 'Return to the Shadows' podcast, McNamara is stepping out on her own in her new show Walker: Independence. The show is a prequel to Walker, and she will play the lead of Abby Walker when it airs this fall on the CW. Other upcoming projects of McNamara include the films Sugar, Jade, and El Tonto.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsGpsYycmKysXaSzbr%2FHmpuor5iqu7Wx0axkoqtdmbyqusZmpaivXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./meghan-markle-parents-141874.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are Meghan Markle's Parents?">&larr;
