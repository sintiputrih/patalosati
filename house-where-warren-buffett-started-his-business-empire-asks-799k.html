But the history behind the property involves the city’s most celebrated man, business mogul Warren Buffett.</p><p>The English-Tudor house served as the 91-year-old’s makeshift office for one of his first solo investment funds, Buffett Associates, back in 1956. Nearly seven decades later, the more than 3,400-square-foot home, located in the upscale Dundee neighborhood, is hitting the market for $799,000.</p><p>Buffett and his then-wife, the late Susan Buffett, rented the residence for just $175 a month (which equates to $1,821 today), according to the biography “<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life</a>,” by Alice Schroeder.</p><p>James and Nancy Monen purchased the home in 2005 for $397,000. When they were looking to buy the house, they had no idea about Buffett’s connection, the Monens <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told the Wall Street Journal</a>, which was the first to report on the upcoming listing.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The home spans more than 3,400 square feet. <span class=credit>Joe Braun</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The entryway to the three-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom house. <span class=credit>Joe Braun</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The formal living room with high-beamed arched ceilings. <span class=credit>Joe Braun</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The living room goes into the dining room and features a Cinderella staircase with a balcony. <span class=credit>Joe Braun</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">Warren Buffett with his then-wife, the late Susan Buffett, and two of their children in 1956. <span class=credit>Omaha World-Herald</span></figure><p>“One day I was going to Target and there was a for sale sign in the yard. We were the first ones to show up, and bought it right then and there,” Nancy told the Journal, adding they only found out about Buffett’s prior residency from the seller during the process of buying the home.</p><p>In 2019, Buffett, along with two of his children, Howard and Susan, stopped by the home unexpectedly, asking Nancy if they could see the “little room” off the upstairs primary bedroom. That was the very room where Buffett started his business ventures that eventually turned him into the money-making man to the tune of $125.1 billion today.</p><p>They were “enchanted” by the sunroom along with the rest of the 103-year-old house they’d lived in six decades ago, according to an interview Nancy did with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">local paper, the Omaha World-Herald.</a> Buffett and his family took photos and waxed nostalgic during their visit. Before he left, he wrote “The birthplace of Buffett Associates May 1956,” on the arched room door off the little room, signing his name Warren E. Buffett.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The primary bedroom. <span class=credit>Joe Braun</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The signed door. <span class=credit>Joe Braun</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Above the arched door in the small sunroom, Warren Buffett wrote: “The birthplace of Buffett Associates May 1956,” and signed his name. <span class=credit>Joe Braun</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The office room off the main bedroom, also known as the sunroom with the arched door that was signed by Warren Buffett. <span class=credit>Joe Braun</span></figure><p>A the time, investors of Buffett Associates pitched in a total of just over $100,000 collectively, a representative for Buffett told the Journal.</p><p>Since the Monens have owned the house, they have rented the home to visitors attending the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting, nicknamed “The Woodstock of Capitalism.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jessica Dembinski </a>of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Ambassador Real Estate, who holds the listing, revealed that the demand for homes is still very high. Specifically estimating they were about “6,000 houses short of where the demand is currently.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The kitchen leads to the family room. <span class=credit>Joe Braun</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The kitchen. <span class=credit>Joe Braun</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The formal dining room. <span class=credit>Joe Braun</span></figure><p>And with all the features of Buffett’s one-time home and its savory history, the property is expected to be snatched up quickly.</p><p>“One of my favorite facts about the house is that it was designed by well-known Omaha Architect, Frederick A. Henninger. It was built in 1918,” Dembinski told The Post. “Every single bedroom on the second floor has its own en-suite bathroom, something quite out of the ordinary for this area of town and the age of the home.”</p><p>“The home also has three fireplaces, multiple outdoor entertaining spaces including a screened-in porch, copper gutters and several of the original leaded windows.”</p><p>The Buffetts lived in the home for two years before paying just $31,500 to buy a different Omaha house only a two-minute drive away, or about $313,000 today. Buffett still lives in the fairly modest five-bedroom, three-bathroom residence today with his second wife, Astrid Menks.</p><p>Records show he updated and renovated his current home in 1989.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7j21mam1fnby2v8RmrqGdopp6uK3Rq5ynZZKqs6ex061krKyRp8GmsIyhoKxlkqrAqrrErKpmnZ2ltrOxjJqqpKtdbIZ6t44%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./babyname.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kellen - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity">&larr;
