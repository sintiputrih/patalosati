These are&nbsp;10 celebrities who had near-death experiences.</p><h2 id=ozzy-osbourne><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Ozzy Osbourne</span></h2><p><a href=#>Ozzy Osbourne</a> had a brush with death when he got into an ATV accident. It was just a regular day when Ozzy was just trying to have a little fun by riding his ATV around his house. "Absolutely no drugs, absolutely no alcohol. It was just a terrible, terrible accident. The last thing I remember, what I do remember is I got on the bike and, and something in my mind went 'bad move. there's something's really bad is gonna happen," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ozzy told reporters</a>.</p><p>Ozzy's heart stopped, and if it wasn't for his bodyguard, Ozzy might not be alive today. He revived Ozzy not once, but twice before he was rushed to the hospital where he had fractured vertebrae, eight rib fractures, a partially collapsed lung, and a fractured left collarbone. After a lot of rehab and time in the hospital, Ozzy is certainly lucky to be alive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tracy-morgan><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Tracy Morgan</span></h2><p>Tracy Morgan is another celeb who had a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">brush with death</a> when he was in a bad car accident. Tracy was in a limo with three others when a Walmart truck collided with his limo, as well&nbsp;as a chain crash with six other cars.

He had to use a wheelchair and go to rehabilitation to help him recover. He also had to undergo treatments for a traumatic brain injury. Tracy is lucky to be alive, and he certainly knows it.&nbsp;After the accident, he tweeted a number of messages, expressing his gratitude for being alive, saying, "I thank GOD for my family. I am eternally grateful for the love and support they give me. My wife, daughter, sons, and friends are what got me back on my feet.

These days she's known for being a Paralympic snowboarding champion, but there was a time where Amy was fighting for her life. Bacterial meningitis attacked her body so much so that she lost her legs as well as her spleen and kidney function. She was so sick that for a while, she thought she wasn't going to make it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking with NPR</a>, Amy explained what it was like to come so close to death. "For me, it was life-changing. I nearly died multiple times in the hospital. I lost my legs, I lost my spleen, I lost my kidney function. I lost the life that I knew. And going through so much in such a small amount of time and so quickly, for me, it put my life into perspective. There were certain things I focused on â€” I focused on how grateful I was for the things I had versus the things I lost. I got a second chance at life and I want to use it. I didn't want to waste it by dwelling on what happened or why it happened."</p><h2 id=gerard-butler><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Gerard Butler</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gerard Butler is another celebrity who had his own brush with death.

That's insane bad luck," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she explained</a>. Emilia had to go through two surgeries after each of the aneurysms&nbsp;to save her life.</p><p>She remembered during the whole thing that she was scared and just trying to stay alive.

The two were riding in the early morning, and there was quite a lot of traffic at that time. Zac didn't have much experience riding in an environment like that and therefore had a run-in with a bus that nearly took his life.</p><p>"I followed Hugh around a few cars and suddenly there was a double-decker bus right in front of me. I slammed on the brakes, and went under the front tire and narrowly missed death," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zac explained the scary situation</a> on&nbsp;The Graham Norton Show.
