Isaak’s career started in 1984.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Chris Isaak is, as of late 2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Isaak’s net worth is as high as $21 million, an amount earned through his successful career in music. However, Isaak also works as an actor, which has contributed to his wealth.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-isaak-net-worth-21-million></span>Chris Isaak Net Worth $21 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Chris Isaak was born to Joe Isaak, a forklift driver, and Dorothy, a potato chip factory worker. He went to the Amos Alonzo Stagg High School, where was a class president before matriculating in 1974. Later, Isaak studied at the San Joaquin Delta Community College and the University of the Pacific, graduating with a Bachelor of English and Communications Arts in 1981.</p><p>Isaak then formed the rock band called Silvertone, while in 1985 he released his debut studio album “Silvertone”, under Warner Bros. Records. The album wasn’t a commercial hit, but songs “Gone Ridin” and “Livin’ for Your Lover” featured in David Lynch’s “Blue Velvet” (1986) starring Kyle MacLachlan, Isabella Rossellini, Dennis Hopper, and Laura Dern. Isaak’s self-titled album came out in 1986, before his breakthrough album “Heart Shaped World” came out in 1989 and peaked at No. 7 on Billboard 200. The release sold over 2.5 million copies in the US and achieved the triple-platinum status, while the single “Wicked Game” reached the Top 10.</p><p>In 1995, Chris released his fifth studio album “Forever Blue”, and it peaked at the No. 31 on the Billboard 200 and No. 27 on the UK Albums chart. It also achieved platinum status in the US, and was nominated for Best Rock Album. The single “Somebody’s Crying” received a Grammy nomination, while “Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing” featured in Stanley Kubrick’s final movie “Eyes Wide Shut” (1999) starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. By the end of the ‘90s, Isaak had recorded two more albums: “Baja Sessions” (1996) and “Speak of the Devil” (1998). His tenth studio album “Mr. Lucky” (2009), reached No.29 on Billboard 200 and No. 10 on Billboard Rock Albums chart. Also in 2009, Chris recorded “Beyond the Sun”, and it peaked at No. 34 on the Billboard 200 and No. 6 on the UK Albums chart, while his latest album “First Comes the Night” (2015) reached 66th place on the Billboard 200. His net worth has risen steadily.</p><p>Isaak debuted on film in Jonathan Demme’s Oscar-nominated “Jonathan Demme” (1988) starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Alec Baldwin, and Paul Lazar, and then had a minor role in Demme’s Oscar-winning thriller “The Silence of the Lambs” (1991) alongside Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, while in 1992, Isaak appeared in David Lynch’s “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me”, all of which added a substantial amount to his net worth. Through the ‘90s Isaak also played in such movies as Bernardo Bertolucci’s “Little Buddha” (1993) with Keanu Reeves and Bridget Fonda, “Grace of My Heart” (1996), and in Tom Hanks’ Oscar-nominated comedy “That Thing You Do!” (1996). From 2001 to 2004, Chris hosted 47 episodes of “The Chris Isaak Show”, and then had parts in John Waters’ “A Dirty Shame” (2004), and in “The Informers” (2008) with Billy Bob Thornton, Kim Basinger, and Mickey Rourke, increasing further his net worth. Most recently, Isaak appeared in an episodes of “Hot in Cleveland” (2014) and David Lynch’s “Twin Peaks: The Missing Pieces” (2014).</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Chris Isaak’s is still single, but most intimate details are generally unknown, as he successfully manages to keep them out of the public eye. It is known that he resides by the beach in the San Francisco Bay area.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Chris Isaak</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$21 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 26, 1956</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Stockton, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6′ 1″ (1.85 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Musician</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>University of the Pacific</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Joe Isaak, Dorothy Isaak</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Nick Isaak, Jeff Isaak</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>https://www.facebook.com/chrisisaak</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>https://twitter.com/chrisisaak</td></tr><tr><td>MySpace</td><td>https://myspace.com/chrisisaak</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001389/</td></tr><tr><td>Allmusic</td><td>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/chris-isaak-mn0000775323</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video, MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a Film, MTV Video Music Award for Best Cinematography, Wicked Game, Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing, Blue Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year, Grammy Award for Best Rock Album, Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, MTV Video Music Award for Best Editing, MTV Video Music Award for Viewer’s Choice, MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction, TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Comed…</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>The Silence of the Lambs, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, Little Buddha, Grace of My Heart, That Thing You Do!, Blue Ridge Fall, A Dirty Shame, The Informers, MTV Unplugged: Ballads, Soundstage: Chris Isaak: Greatest Hits Live, Chris Isaak: Baja Sessions, Last Man Standing Live</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>The Chris Isaak Show, From the Earth to the Moon, The Chris Isaak Hour</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks><tr><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>His name in glitter, printed on his concert guitars</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Embroidered western/cowboy shirts.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Roy Orbison falsetto-style voice</td></tr></table><table class=quotes><tr><th>Quote</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>How close is Bullwinkle to a real moose?</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Just because there’s a camera running doesn’t mean you won’t get killed.</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Bruce Weber shot the photo art for his self titled second album, “Chris Isaak” in 1986.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Was an amateur boxer while in college.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Collects small red sculptural pieces which light up electronically.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>When he visits his mother, who is still living in his childhood home in Stockton, California, he still cleans the yard for her.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>His father was a forklift driver/operator and his mother, of Peruvian decent, was a factory worker.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>The 1999 music video for “Baby Did a Bad, Bad Thing” was directed by Herb Ritts, and featured Isaak and French supermodel Laetitia Casta.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>The 1991 black and white music video for “Wicked Game” was directed by Herb Ritts, and featured Isaak and supermodel Helena Christensen.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Is a fourth generation Stocktonian (Stockton, California, USA).
