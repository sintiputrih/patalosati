Before that, he served at CNN from 1995 to 2005 for nearly a decade. While working with CNN, he has hosted various programs such as CNN Tonight,&nbsp;CNN Morning News, American Morning,&nbsp;and few others.</p><h2>Who is Bill Hemmer's Wife?</h2><p>Many would expect the charming and a famous new anchor Bill to have a wife somewhere. But sadly he still hasn't tied the knot, so it would be rubbish to ask about his life partner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/17/5e3191be62fa81205f6f9363-1600351357458.jpg><p>Nevertheless, the 55-year-old Hemmer has not talked much about his personal life with the media or in any interviews yet. Therefore due to his secretive nature, there is no exact information regarding his current love affairs with a possible partner.&nbsp;</p><p>It seems, he is not dating anyone currently. On the other hand, his reserved personality has contributed to rumours suggesting he is gay. But gay rumours are common among stars who have chosen to be discreet about their love lives.&nbsp;</p><p>To date, Bill hasn't spoken any single word about these rumours. But we believe that they are untrue.</p><h2>Seven Years of Ex-Girlfriend, Dara Tomanovich</h2><p>Before remaining as a single guy, the 1.75&nbsp;m tall anchor was in a romantic love relationship with model and actress, <strong>Dara Tomanovich</strong>. As a model, she has worked for British Vogue, Marie Claire, and L’Oreal.</p><p>Hemmer and Tomanovich had their first interaction in 2005. But they were seen spotted cosying up for the first time during the&nbsp;Victoria’s Secret&nbsp;Fashion Show. Since then, the two started making appearances together on several function and programs.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/17/Bill-Hemmer-and-Dara-Tomanovich--1600354033829.jpg><p>During their dating period, they had a great time together with lovely memories. But it was reported that the couple spilt in 2013 after nearly eight years of dating. Likewise, their last appearances together was the 2013 Gala event held at the City Centre in Berlin.&nbsp;</p><p>After their break up,&nbsp;Dana attempted to threaten the officer who arrested her driving under the impact of alcohol in June of 2014. Also, there was a rumour that she was dating Britain's, <strong>Prince Andrew</strong>, the ex-husband of <a href=#><strong>Sarah, Duchess Of York</strong></a>.</p><h2>Bill Hemmer's Total Net Worth</h2><p>From his journalism career spanning more than two decades, Bill is making a considerable amount of money. As of 2020, his total net worth is around <strong>$9 Million</strong>. He owes his staggering worth to his successful broadcasting work.</p><p>Hemmer joined Fox News&nbsp;on August 15 and started working as a morning co-anchor of America’s Newsroom alongside<strong> </strong><a href=#><strong>Sandra Smith</strong></a>. However, in January 2020, he got chance to work for his own <a href=# rel=nofollow>show</a> 3 p.m. news hour, Bill Hemmer Reports, after <strong>Shepard Smith</strong>'s resignation after working for 24 years.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/17/Capture-1600355619511.JPG><p>Today, it is believed that he makes a salary of <strong>$3 million</strong> per year. His notable works at FN include the 2006 Israel-Lebanon Crisis, the Hurricane Katrina aftermath, and the British Sailors' Hostage situation in Iran. Prior to Fox, he worked at CNN&nbsp;between1995 to 2005.</p><h2>Bio and Education</h2><p>He was born on 14 November 1964 in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. He is the middle child of <strong>William R. Hemmer</strong>, a retired mattress industrial-company executive, and <strong>Georganne M. Knittle, </strong>a homemaker. He has three siblings, two sisters and one <strong>brother</strong>.</p><p>Hemmer holds American citizenship and belongs to white ethnicity. He studied the Our Lady of Victory (Cincinnati) and graduated from Elder High School in 1983. Then later, he attended Miami University, located in Oxford, Ohio where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in broadcast journalism.</p><p>He also joined Delta Tau Delta fraternity and also went to study at the Miami University Dolibois European Center while at Miami University.</p><p><strong>Keep Visiting </strong><a href=#><strong>Marriedceleb</strong></a><strong>!!!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jpugpaRdnbKuucSr</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-can-you-get-banned-on-tiktok.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How can you get banned on TikTok?">&larr;
