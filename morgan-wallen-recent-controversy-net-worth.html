The young singer-songwriter became a hit in 2016, and while more than one of his songs ranked on Billboard charts, "Whiskey Glasses" was arguably his biggest success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But then, footage of Wallen using a racial slur was released by TMZ. After that, things went downhill for the country superstar, and it doesn't seem like his reputation has recovered since.</p><p>Still, with all his music out in the world (and on Spotify and Apple Music, of course), has Morgan Wallen's net worth suffered because of the controversy?</p><h2 id=how-much-money-has-morgan-wallen-made>How Much Money Has Morgan Wallen Made?</h2><p>It's not quite clear just how much money Morgan Wallen has made during his career. After competing on 'The Voice,' the star built up an impressive net worth of about $4 million. Depending on the source, however, that estimate ranges from $2.5 million to about $4M.</p><p>The 28-year-old pulled in millions from his album sales, earned some accolades for penning country songs for other artists (he wrote Jason Aldean's "You Make It Easy"), and had a standing record deal with Big Loud records.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, his scandal in early 2021 led to Wallen being suspended from his record label. And yet, he hasn't faded into obscurity because of the scandal...</p><h2 id=did-morgan-wallen-get-canceled>Did Morgan Wallen Get Canceled?</h2><p>Though he went on 'Good Morning America' in an effort to apologize to fans following the TMZ video leak, not everyone was impressed. His interview came down to a <a href=#>battle between fans over whether Morgan was in the right</a>, or if Michael Strahan had a point about his wrongdoings.</p><p>Some said that Wallen's apology was purely lip service and that he was only appearing to help save his image. Did it work, though?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kevin Spacey & 9 Other Actors Who Made Movie Comebacks After Getting Cancelled</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It might be too soon to tell. Though early 2021 was relatively kind to Morgan, with various songs of his rising up the commercial charts, he hasn't released a new album yet, which led fans to speculate that he'd been blacklisted in the industry.</p><p>But social media offers up hints as to how things are going for the artist these days.</p><h2 id=what-has-morgan-wallen-being-doing-since-his-scandal>What Has Morgan Wallen Being Doing Since His Scandal?</h2><p>Racial slurs aside, Morgan Wallen doesn't seem to have any other drama happening. In fact, this summer, he appeared in concert with Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean, and Tyler Hubbard. He's also releasing new music, which he's shared on his Instagram.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here’s Why Fans Think ‘The Voice’ Is Completely Staged</a></span></p><p>Judging by his 2.6M followers (who all seem to be very supportive of him and his music), Morgan Wallen is doing pretty well these days. He even wrote fans a seemingly heartfelt letter that he shared on Instagram. Similar to <a href=#>the way Billie Eilish previously repented</a>, Wallen admitted to his wrongdoings and felt kind of embarrassed by his past behavior.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In that letter, Wallen explained how proud he was of his music, how much he loves his fans, and how hard he's willing to work to keep growing as an artist and a person. Though he's had a lot of drama lately, it doesn't seem like Wallen has lost many fans, which means his career is still on the upswing.</p><h2 id=did-morgan-wallen-lose-money-from-his-scandal>Did Morgan Wallen Lose Money From His Scandal?</h2><p>Though a lot of fans stood in Morgan's 'unpopular corner,' as he called it, some did defect. The music industry also punished the singer for his misstep, with some platforms pulling his tracks from their streaming services.</p><p>SiriusXM and iHeart Radio, for example, removed Wallen's music from their platforms. CMT even nixed him from the network, and Wallen lost eligibility for the CMAs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But how much did those perceived slights impact Wallen's bottom line?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Country Music Star Luke Bryan's $160 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Not much, sources suggest. In fact, Morgan Wallen's music had a surprisingly positive upward surge after all the drama of his racial slur came out. The old saying that any publicity is good publicity may just be true for the singer.</p><p>The more the public heard about Wallen, the more curious they became about his music (if they hadn't already heard it), and that led to more sales of his albums on the few services that continued to offer it.</p><h2 id=how-much-did-morgan-wallen-39-s-sales-increase>How Much Did Morgan Wallen's Sales Increase?</h2><p>It seems like Morgan Wallen's net worth may have increased rather than tanked after the incident. After all, his music was streamed a bit less, but album sales were up. The bottom line? NY Times reported that after the scandal erupted, Wallen's album sales <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">jumped by 49 percent</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And as far as Morgan Wallen's earnings for 2021, he's apparently made about a half-million dollars this calendar year, even though he promised he'd sit out concerts and events (which are two of his money-makers).</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>How Close Did Danica Patrick Come To Becoming A Country Music Singer?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikqKqXlrtuw8Clo56mXaeypLHNrWScp56pv7DCxKuqsmWemsFuw86rq6Fn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./snls-kate-mckinnon-rips-apart-floridas-dont-say-gay-bill-i-am-deeply-gay.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="SNLs Kate McKinnon Rips Apart Floridas Dont Say Gay Bill: I Am Deeply Gay">&larr;
