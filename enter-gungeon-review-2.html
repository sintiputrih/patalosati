What that means for the gameplay is that each character you choose has a special boss to beat to reach this goal… assuming you can make it that far. &nbsp;Enter the Gungeon can be pretty hard. &nbsp;Bullet hell games can be taxing, requiring great dexterity as they get tougher and tougher. &nbsp;Gungeon is no exception. &nbsp;The game gives you some options when starting out. &nbsp;You can choose between a few different types of characters, each with different starting weapons, each with their own special abilities. &nbsp;One character, for example The Pilot, starts with a laser gun as his main weapon, but his perk is a lock pick, which can help in opening chests when you’ve run out of keys. &nbsp;Another is the Hunter, who starts with two weapons and a canine companion who can occasionally dig up items for you upon completing a room. &nbsp;There are two other starting characters, three if you count cooperative play. &nbsp;Each have their own skill sets.</p><p>Gameplay in Enter the Gungeon features pixel perfect shooting at a wide variety of interesting enemies that are shooting back at you. &nbsp;They send hails of bullets your way, and it’s up to you to avoid them or lose your life bar. &nbsp;There’s quite a few ways to do this. &nbsp;You can dodge roll to avoid bullets, chasms, and other hazards. &nbsp;You can use blanks to eviscerate all bullets on the screen at one time. &nbsp;You can even kick over things like tables to form make shift cover in most rooms. &nbsp;While Enter the Gungeon starts off fairly easy on the first level, things can get pretty hectic as you progress.&nbsp;You’ll need to put all these things together alongside, hopefully, some powerful weapons that you’ve picked up or purchased along the way. &nbsp;My favorite of which is a light gun resembling that of the NES Zapper, which shoots light beams and a heat-seeking duck. &nbsp;Though honestly, every other playthrough I’ve found something that I’ve thought was my new favorite, a sure signal that there’s a lot of variety in the weapons to be found.</p><img title="Enter The Gungeon Review" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gungeon-review-3.jpg alt=gungeon-review-3 width=760 height=428 sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Clearing each level will require you to fight a boss, and even these can be random for any given playthrough. It’s not all random all the time though. Enter the Gungeon borrows a mechanic from other Rogue likes in its loot pool mechanic. Where reaching special vendors or different NPCs will allow you to purchase guns that can be permanently added to the loot pool while others will allow you to take a shortcut and start the game on deeper levels of the Gungeon. That said, it feels somewhat like Spelunky in that starting from the beginning will give you the best chance to beat the game as you can easily breeze through the early levels after you’ve played with a little experience, picking up power-ups and currency in the process.</p><p>While there is cooperative play in Enter the Gungeon it’s only local at the moment. This is unfortunate because this would probably be a ton of fun to play with a friend online and I’d probably score this game as perfect if it had it. &nbsp;I could see sinking many hours into this game with an online partner. &nbsp;That’s one of the only things I can really complain about with this game. Because of the random nature of it, each playthrough can be entirely unique. While it can get a little disheartening to die three levels into the Gungeon, it’s just as fun to get right back in there as you never know what guns or power-ups you’ll find on your next playthrough and how it’ll affect your progress. Couple that ‘one more run’ feeling that you get from the game with a great pixel art style and audio presentation, and Enter the Gungeon is a no-brainer for Rogue like fans or even newcomers to the genre.</p><img title="Enter The Gungeon Review" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gungeon-review-2.jpg alt=gungeon-review-2 width=760 height=428 sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>While most of this review consisted of time spent with the near finished PC Early Access version on Steam, we also played around with the PlayStation 4 version, both are equally viable options and it’s hard to distinguish any true differences between the two games. Hopefully, Dodge Roll stays true to their word and continues to support this title going forward. The developer has already suggested that they’d be adding new content post-launch, which includes new guns, items, bosses which would certainly make the replay value high on a game that already feels like it has plenty baked-in.</p><h3>The Verdict</h3><p>While the Rogue like genre may be getting a little crowded, there’s certainly room for the likes of Enter the Gungeon. &nbsp;It ticks all the boxes, with gameplay that beckons you to come back for one more run, a great art style and presentation, and seemingly something new discover or unlock on every playthrough.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKmupLfOn6uhnZaWu6O72GeaqKVfp7K3tcSwqmidnqmys3nGrqWgnZ%2BjerOx1aKcsGViZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./harvey-jason.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Harvey Jason">&larr;
