Social Media star Jasmine Chiswell and her husband Maverick McNeilly have welcomed their first child, a baby boy.</p><p>Jasmine is well known all over Instagram and Tiktok because of her videos where she is dressed as Marilyn Monroe or generally dressed in 50s style. She has over 1.1 million followers on her <a href=#>Instagram</a> and 14.4 million followers on <a href=#>Tiktok</a>.</p><p>But who is her husband? Has she revealed anything about her husband? Is her husband famous too? Find out answers to all these questions and a detailed bio about Jasmine Chiswell’s husband, Maverick McNeilly.</p><h3><strong>Meet Maverick McNeilly, Jasmine Chiswell Husband</strong></h3><p>Before any other detail about Maverick’s life, let us answer the question of how Jasmine Chiswell and her music producer husband Maverick McNeilly met, fell in love, got married, and now had a child.</p><p>Jasmine was born and raised in Scotland. She came to the United States at the age of 22 to pursue her dream to became an actor. She first came to the US as a film student. And in the early days, she did not think that she would marry an American and settle.</p><p>Still, Jasmine started dating and using dating apps for that. And her early dating experiences were not very good. Most of the guys she found on dating apps and went out with just wanted to “hear her accent” and did not want to know her.</p><p>Maverick, however, was different. They matched on Bumble. They talked a couple of times. And then they were having their first date. Then not even after four months after they moved in together. A few months later they got engaged. And within six months of that, they were married.</p><p>Jasmine and Maverick have also bought a house together. And it is the house that used to belong to Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio. Jasmine and Maverick have agreed upon three kids. One is already here, two are yet to come.</p><p>Jasmine and Maverick announced their pregnancy in May 2021. And from May 2021 to January 2022, Jasmine’s and Maverick’s social media are filled with videos about pregnancy and the new baby. On 7 September, Jasmine uploaded a Gender Reveal video on her Youtube channel and announced that it was a baby boy.</p><p>Both Jasmine and Maverick announced the <a href=#>arrival of their baby boy</a> on their social media.</p><h3><strong>Maverick McNeilly Age</strong></h3><p>According to the reports, Maverick McNeilly was born in the year 1988.

He is a musician, a music producer, a DJ, and a lifelong music lover. And Mr. Skeleton is the alias he goes by in the music world. People have described Mr. Skeleton as “one of the TOP LA Dubsteppers”. And apparently, he is “loved and worshipped by many”.</p><p>The Partyflock.nl website further says about Maverick’s music, “His unique blend of synths and sounds add an air of mystery to his sets – keeping listeners hooked on every strange beat. His elusive character and incomparable mixing style provide a raw and energetic experience, unlike any other DJ performance.”</p><p>You can find Mr. Skeleton’s music on Soundcloud and Spotify.</p><p>Apart from music, Maverick is also a social media celebrity by association. That is to say that not only does he appear on his wife’s famous social media channels but he also shares the fashion sense with her. He also dresses in the 50s fashion.</p><p>When Jasmine first started to dress in the 50s style, he readily followed suit. And even though the fact that some people stare at them for their old fashion sense, neither of them was fazed.</p><p>Conversely, Jasmine has also worked with Maverick on his music projects.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Maverick McNeilly Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>As of 2022, Music producer Maverick McNeilly has a net worth of over $600 thousand.</p><h3><strong>Maverick McNeilly Height</strong></h3><p>Reportedly, Maverick McNeilly stands at a height of not more than 5 ft 11 inches.</p><h3><strong>Maverick McNeilly Family</strong></h3><p>Coming to Maverick McNeilly’s family outside of his wife and their unborn daughter, Maverick’s mother’s name is Kim O’Brien, who is a real estate professional based in Granite Bay, California.</p><p>Maverick also has a sister called <a href=#>Samantha McNeilly</a>.
