Van Dien had a son and a daughter from a previous marriage: Casper Robert Mitchum Van Dien and actress Caroline <a href=#>Grace Van Dien</a>. Van Dien and Oxenberg have two daughters together: <a href=#>Maya Van Dien</a> (born 2001) and Celeste Alma Van Dien (born 2003).</p><p>Oxenberg acknowledged, in November 2017, that she had interactions with <a href=#>Keith Raniere</a> and his NXIVM organization, bringing her daughter India into NXIVM in 2011 for what she thought would be "a self-help, business-oriented program". Oxenberg confirmed that her daughter became heavily involved in the cult, and that she had initiated what proved to be a failed intervention for India. In August 2018, Oxenberg revealed that India had left NXIVM in June, after the arrest of Raniere, and they were working on their relationship. In August 2018, Oxenberg's book Captive: A Mother's Crusade to Save Her Daughter from a Terrifying Cult was published.</p><p>As of 2011, Oxenberg was 3936th in the line of succession to the throne of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth Realms.</p><p>Oxenberg was portrayed by <a href=#>Rachael Taylor</a> in the 2005 telemovie Dynasty: The Making of a Guilty Pleasure, a fictionalized retelling of the behind-the-scenes goings-on during the production of Dynasty. In 2006, Oxenberg appeared in the TV special, Dynasty Reunion: Catfights & Caviar, in which she was reunited with her former Dynasty castmates to reminisce about the series.</p><p>Conan O'Brien mentioned in a 2000 commencement speech that Oxenberg is listed directly ahead of him in the Class of 1985 Harvard freshman Facebook. A contemporary Harvard Crimson piece indicates that she was at least initially in the Class of 1983, dubbing her "queen of the Facebook".</p><p>Oxenberg met actor <a href=#>Casper Van Dien</a> during the filming of the 1999 TV movie The Collectors, and they worked together again in the 1999 Evangelical Christian thriller The Omega Code. On May 8, 1999, they married at Graceland Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2005, the couple appeared in their own reality series, I Married a Princess, which aired on the Lifetime Television channel in the United States and on LIVINGtv in the United Kingdom. Van Dien filed for divorce from Oxenberg in 2015.</p><p>Oxenberg's first marriage was to the producer Robert Evans, in Beverly Hills, California, on July 12, 1998, but the marriage was annulled nine days later.</p><p>Oxenberg was the guest host on the May 10, 1986 episode of Saturday Night Live, making her the only descendant of a royal family to host the show. Oxenberg starred as Princess Elysa in the 1987 television film Roman Holiday. She also appeared in The Lair of the White Worm in 1988, and reprised the role of Diana, Princess of Wales in the TV film Charles and Diana: Unhappily Ever After in 1992. From 1993 to 1994, she starred in the short-lived series Acapulco H.E.A.T..</p><p>Oxenberg made her acting debut in the 1982 made-for-television film The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana, in which she played Diana, Princess of Wales. In 1984, Oxenberg joined the hit ABC prime time soap opera Dynasty — then at its height of popularity — in the role of Amanda Carrington. Oxenberg left Dynasty in 1986, following a salary dispute after the end of her second season, and the role was recast with <a href=#>Karen Cellini</a>. Though Oxenberg's publicist insisted that the actress left Dynasty voluntarily, several media outlets reported that she was fired.</p><p>Catherine Oxenberg (born September 22, 1961) is an American actress. Best known for her performance as Amanda Carrington on the 1980s prime time soap opera Dynasty, she is the daughter of <a href=#>Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia</a> and <a href=#>Howard Oxenberg</a>.</p><p>Oxenberg was born in New York City, but grew up in London. She is the eldest daughter of <a href=#>Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia</a> (born 1936) and her first husband <a href=#>Howard Oxenberg</a> (1919–2010), a Jewish dress manufacturer and close friend of the Kennedy family.
