Taking lead on the original W.A.S.P material, Oliver Tindall, who was introduced to the band after sharing the bill with Chris in Welwyn Garden City with his own band The Wicked Jackals. Alongside Ollie and also recruited from The Wicked Jackals, is his new bassist Lex Gifford. Tying the 4 piece together is <a href=#>Stephen Jackson</a>, on drums whom Chris met 2 years prior with Alexa De Strange from Heart Break Remedy.</p><p>On November 26, 2012, <a href=#>Chris Holmes</a> released his first solo album Nothing to Lose and decided to produce, manage and distribute it himself along with his wife <a href=#>Catherine Holmes</a>. After the success of his first album, Chris started recording his second solo album, Shitting Bricks. On May 2, 2015, that album was released worldwide and on the same day <a href=#>Chris Holmes</a> played his first concert in Nantes, France with his new band Mean Man . Two of the songs were filmed live, and uploaded to the official YouTube channel. In September 2018, Chris recorded the EP "Under the Influence" at Replug studio, mixed by Raphael Gary and produced by Chris and <a href=#>Catherine Holmes</a>. It was released on the 2nd December 2018 in Dublin. The album is scheduled to be released in 2020.</p><p>In 2014 <a href=#>Chris Holmes</a> and <a href=#>Catherine Holmes</a> moved to Finland, but after living in Porvoo for a few months they moved to France where Catherine's parents lived. The couple currently resides in Cannes, France.</p><p>In 2010, he joined Where Angels Suffer with <a href=#>Randy Piper</a> on guitar, Steve Unger (Metal Church) on bass, <a href=#>Rich Lewis</a> (Animal), on vocals, and <a href=#>Stet Howland</a> on drums (Blackfoot, <a href=#>Lita Ford</a>, Killing Machine, Belladonna, Impellitteri, Sister and W.A.S.P.). <a href=#>Ira Black</a> has since replaced Piper. The band toured Europe for the first time in 2011.</p><p>After Holmes returned to Los Angeles in late 2003, he began working with several Southern California-based metal groups, producing and contributing guitar tracks. In 2007, Holmes was involved in the filming of a Randy Rhoads documentary directed by Peter M. Margolis, which is yet to be released. Holmes appears briefly in a 2009 episode of VH1's Rock Docs, "Do It For The Band: The Women of Sunset Strip." In the Summer of 2009 Holmes released Secret Society's "Death by Misadventure."</p><p>Holmes' contribution to the 1988 documentary is perhaps the most memorable, because he was interviewed while floating in a swimming pool, fully clothed and visibly quite intoxicated while his mother sat poolside. The interview stood out in stark contrast to the more light-hearted and humorous interviews conducted by director <a href=#>Penelope Spheeris</a>, which mostly portrayed rockers as good-natured, though often dimwitted or deluded, party animals. During the interview, Holmes smiled drunkenly at the camera, deeming himself "a full-blown alcoholic" and "a piece of crap" despite his band's success, and punctuated his remarks by guzzling from three bottles of vodka. At the end of the interview, Holmes opens a full bottle of Smirnoff over his head as he rolls out of his inflatable chair and into the water.</p><p>Prior to meeting <a href=#>Blackie Lawless</a> and <a href=#>Randy Piper</a>, and joining W.A.S.P., Holmes played guitar with Los Angeles bands Buster Savage, LAX, and Slave. Holmes joined W.A.S.P. from 1982 to 1990, playing on the first four studio albums and the first live album. In 1996 Holmes rejoined W.A.S.P., and remained lead guitarist until 2001. Holmes has not played with W.A.S.P. since.</p><p>While a member of W.A.S.P., Holmes participated in the filming of the documentary film, The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years. The film included interviews with many well known heavy metal personalities of the era discussing their lifestyle and the metal scene in late 1980s Los Angeles.</p><p><a href=#>Chris Holmes</a> has been married three times. His first marriage was to Kaylen Rodgers in the late 1980s. He was briefly married to <a href=#>Lita Ford</a> in the early 1990s. He is now married to <a href=#>Catherine Holmes</a>, whom he wed in August 2012.</p><p>Christopher John Holmes (born June 23, 1958) is an American heavy metal guitarist and songwriter. Holmes started his musical career in the Pasadena, California area in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He is best known as the lead guitarist of heavy metal band W.A.S.P. Together with <a href=#>Blackie Lawless</a> and <a href=#>Randy Piper</a> he was one of the founding members of the band. Holmes was a member of W.A.S.P. first from 1982 to 1990, and again from 1996 to 2001.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfmLWztdJmn6iknZrAbrnUrKCcoZGj</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-money-does-renee-maloney-make-latest-renee-maloney-net-worth-income-salary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Does Rene Maloney Make?
