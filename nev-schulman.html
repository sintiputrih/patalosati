The concept of the documentary is centered on Schulman meeting a girl online with whom he ultimately falls in love. However, he soon discovers that she is not what she seems to be. Catfish was subsequently adapted into a television series by MTV in <i>2012</i>, titled Catfish: The TV Show. Schulman served as both the project's host and executive producer.</p><p><i>Catfish </i>earned Nev Schulman and his co-host Max Joseph a Teen Choice Award nomination in 2014 for Choice TV Personality: Male.
