They’re all ifs. It’s frustrating, 100 per cent. Don’t think I’m still not burning about how it’s gone. I still kick myself for it. But on the other side, am I going to keep kicking myself, because I can’t change it?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Can I help myself going forward? That’s why I went on loan, why I went to Aston Villa and Burnley on loan, which didn’t work, and going to Turkey at the age of 30 – I never thought I’d do that.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It’s also the reason I dropped down to the Championship (with Reading).

You figure out you’re not involved in games, only training, so I could go out with the lads, I’m single, it’s great, I can do all this. I was loving it, but in the background, there’s always things that burn away.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘And as a person, if you’re not open enough to speak to the right people, it chews away at you. I didn’t learn that until further down the line. I was always like “I’m a big strong bloke, I can deal with this”.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Drinkwater made headlines for the wrong reason in 2019, after he was banned from the roads for 20 months following a crash near his home while he was&nbsp;two-and-a-half times over the legal limit.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And along with multiple losses in his family, Drinkwater admits he was suffering from mental health issues at the time.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I was [suffering with mental health issues in 2019].
